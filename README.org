* assa-scrape

This small package uses Python's nice [[http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/][Beautiful Soup]] ([[http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/][documentation]])
to scrape the web version of the [[https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2016conference/program/preliminary.php][program]] for the 2016 ASSA economics
meeting (in San Francisco) and produce an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]] file, as well
as a [[http://bradclicks.com/CSSplay/foldingList.html][collapsible HTML file]] (the native ASSA version displays as a flat
list).

The main file is aea.org, which includes a source bit that is the
actual code.  There are random other bits and pieces in aea.org which
can be safely ignored.
