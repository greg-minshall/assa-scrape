						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14298_abstract">The
 Great Depression of the 1930s was followed by a series of regulatory 
and policy decisions that laid the groundwork for a twenty-year post-war
 expansion with stable prices and stable financial markets. The recent 
crisis has also been characterized by regulatory and policy decisions 
aimed at isolating government from responsibility for financial 
instability and increasing the role of the Federal Reserve in regulatory
 and supervisory matters. While financial markets have recovered, they 
remain highly volatile, and the recovery in real activity has been 
feeble. Are governments, politicians and economists less able to draw 
the appropriate lessons from the recent crisis than they were in the 
1930s?</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14336_abstract">It
 is relatively well accepted that transactions costs weigh upon water 
markets and deter some transfers. But despite the fact that this type of
 cost appears to be key to a low level of water exchange, only few 
studies explicitly implement such a cost in their analyses. In the 
present paper we intend to fill this gap using a tool from recent and 
well established international trade literature: the gravity equation. 
We first develop a theoretical model to assess the micro-foundation of 
such an instrument in a water market context. The model distinguishes a 
variable and a fixed cost of trade, which allows us to disentangle the 
intensive and the extensive margin of water trading. Then we test the 
theoretical predictions using water transfer data within California at 
the level of water districts over a 17-year period. We classically 
approximate transaction costs with distances and institutional factors. 
Results validate the theoretical prediction and show the importance of 
distance and institutional factors in the decision to trade, with an 
emphasis on the extensive margin of water trade. Furthermore, we believe
 that this paper opens a new path in this particular research field and 
should allow better analysis of the performance of water markets.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14337_abstract">We
 analyze the adaptation of water systems to climate change through 
infrastructure and conservation. We build a simple model in which the 
primary purpose of water-storage capacities is to manage inter-seasonal 
variation in water endowment and demand, and climate change is assumed 
to change total precipitation, its rain/snow distribution, evaporation 
of water stored in reservoirs, and the water demand. We show that the 
impact of climate change on the marginal benefit of water-storage 
capacities and input-efficiency in water use depends on the intensity of
 climate change and initial conditions about the climate and water 
demand, and climate change does not necessarily lead to increases or 
decreases in either conservation or storage. Some of our results are 
apparently counterintuitive and can generate policy and more general 
implications for adaptations to climate change in the water sector.</div>

 negotiations between surface water and groundwater users in Idaho 
highlight a potential mechanism to resolve costly conflict that has 
arisen in many areas of the western U.S. where surface and groundwater 
resources are hydraulically connected. This article studies this type of
 agreement by developing a simple, dynamic model of cooperative 
bargaining between surface and groundwater users. The model reflects the
 potential gains to both types of water users from bargaining over a 
sustained reduction in groundwater pumping to increase surface water 
flows. In a non-cooperative setting, surface water users choose the 
groundwater pumping reduction to maximize their net production rents, 
but doing so is costly, which creates an incentive for surface water 
users to negotiate with groundwater users. With the theoretical model, 
we demonstrate that the Nash bargaining path of curtailments is lower 
than that in the non-cooperative outcome, but that it may be larger or 
smaller than the first-best outcome. The difference between the 
bargaining and first-best outcomes depends on the efficiency of 
groundwater irrigation and the relative bargaining power of surface 
water and groundwater users. In a numerical simulation, we show that 
when surface water users possess greater bargaining influence, the 
bargaining solution involves larger curtailments than is socially 
optimal and an improvement in irrigation efficiency drives the 
bargaining solution closer to the non-cooperative outcome. Conversely, 
when groundwater users possess greater bargaining influence, 
curtailments are lower than the socially optimal level and an 
improvement in efficiency drives the bargaining solution closer to the 
first-best. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10231_abstract">How,
 and why, does racial segregation affect voting behavior? We theorize 
that local racial context shapes individuals' expressed identities, 
which directly affects their political behavior. To test this theory we 
leverage natural geography as a conditionally exogenous instrument for 
sustained segregation in post-Apartheid South Africa, and study its 
consequences using aggregated voting and micro-level attitudinal data. 
Natural physical barriers such as hills, valleys, and rivers, enable 
states, or citizens of powerful economic in-groups, to partition urban 
and suburban spaces by race. In the South African context, such natural 
barriers were used for decades by the Apartheid regime explicitly for 
the purpose of separating race groups. The end of Apartheid in 1991 
allowed for a rapid influx of black (and other non-white) South Africans
 into previously exclusively white urban and suburban areas, but 
re-integration was not uniform. We show that the presence of natural 
physical barriers sustained pre-existing segregation, differentially 
retarding re-integration in former racial enclaves. Using a two-stage 
least squares approach, we explore the political consequences of 
sustained segregation by considering the effect of changes in both the 
white share of the population and spatial segregation on voting 
behavior. We find that voters in white-only areas, and high segregation 
areas, to become less likely to vote for a non-white party, at rates 
that cannot be explained by simple racial voting or spatial sorting. We 
then explore geo-referenced survey data for roughly 50,000 individuals, 
and show micro-level evidence consistent with the aggregate findings and
 theory.</div>

 wealth persist over time despite historical shocks like colonisation? 
One strand of literature suggests no: Acemoglu et al. argue that 
colonisation brought bad institutions to most of sub-Saharan Africa that
 caused a ‘reversal of fortune’. Another strand of literature suggests 
the opposite: despite several centuries of colonialism in Latin America,
 Valencia and Caicedo argue, ‘persistence dominate’. This paper uses the
 case of South Africa to show that while populations persist, wealth 
does not. Densely populated regions before colonialism are still densely
 populated. But institutional differences imposed by the colonial 
authorities caused a subnational divergence in the fortunes of the 
indigenous population, reflected in unemployment outcomes today.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10233_abstract">We
 investigate whether labor migration can offer an alternative pathway 
out of agriculture and facilitate structural change in rural labor 
markets. Specifically, we investigate whether large‐scale male 
outmigration from rural Malawi between 1940 and 1994 changed the 
structure of rural production away from agriculture by encouraging women
 to enter the labor force and shifting workers towards non‐farm 
occupations and industries. Malawi’s historical migration experiences, 
driven largely by external demand for labor from South African mines 
during apartheid, reduced local supplies of male labor and altered 
relative supplies of male and female labor, potentially affecting female
 labor force participation. Labor migration potentially relaxed local 
capital constraints by providing access to remittances. Access to 
capital through this channel could have expanded opportunities for 
non‐farm work and business development among men and women. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world with an annual (PPP)
 GDP per capita of around 900 USD and large gender gaps in labor market 
outcomes. Since the 1940s, there has been a shift in the economy away 
from exclusive agriculture towards services, although agriculture still 
constituted 30% of GDP in 2009. Between 1940 and 1994, Malawi 
experienced massive outmigration. In some years, over 20% of the adult 
male working age population was working on a South African mine. Mine 
contracts ensured that this migration was circular in nature, with men 
returning after two year contracts. The removal of so many men from 
rural economies undoubtedly affected labor left behind. Migrant workers 
were legally bound by deferred payment agreements to send a majority of 
their wages back to Malawi. Hence, this migration likely increased the 
availability of cash in these rural economies, with possible effects on 
home investments, agriculture, and new businesses.</div>

 largest and most important flow of scientific talent in the world is 
the migration of international students to the doctoral programs in 
science and mathematics offered by universities in industrialized 
countries. This paper uses the opening up of China in 1978 to estimate 
the causal effect of this flow on the productivity of their professors 
in mathematics departments across the United States. Our identification 
strategy relies on both the suddenness of the opening of China and on a 
key feature of scientific production: intra-ethnic collaboration. The 
new Chinese students were more likely to be mentored by American 
professors with Chinese heritage. The increased access that the 
Chinese-American advisors had to a new pool of considerable talent led 
to a substantial increase in their productivity. Despite these sizable 
intra-ethnic knowledge spillovers, comparable non-Chinese advisors 
experienced a decline in the number of students they mentored and a 
concurrent decline in their research productivity. In fact, the 
productivity gains accruing to Chinese-American advisors were almost 
exactly offset by the losses suffered by the non-Chinese advisors. 
Finally, the evidence does not support the conjecture that the 
efficiency gains from the supply shock will be more evident in the next 
generation, as the Chinese students begin to contribute to mathematical 
knowledge. The rate of publication and the quality of the output of the 
Chinese students is comparable to that of the American students in their
 cohort.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12229_abstract">This
 paper presents the first evidence on the efficacy of a major program 
designed to encourage the return migration of high-skilled individuals. 
The Malaysian Returning Expert Program (REP) targets high-skilled 
Malaysians abroad, and provides them with incentives to return to 
Malaysia. We use the fact that at several thresholds the probability of 
acceptance to the program increases discontinuously, to identify the 
impact of acceptance to the REP (conditional on having applied) on the 
probability of returning to Malaysia. In the full sample of applicants 
the estimated treatment effect is positive, but not statistically 
significant. However, we find REP highly effective for the subgroup of 
applicants who already have an employment offer in Malaysia when 
applying (19% of the sample). For this group we find that the causal 
impact of approval is a 47% increase in the return probability. We 
conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the REP and find net fiscal benefits 
in present discounted value of Malaysian Ringgit 18,000 – 36,000 ($6,000
 - $12,000) per applicant.</div>

 study the prevalence and traits of global collaborative U.S. patents 
for U.S. public companies, defined to be patents with at least one 
inventor inside the United States and one abroad. Collaborative patents 
are frequently observed when a U.S. public company is entering into a 
new foreign region for innovative work, especially in less developed 
settings where intellectual property protection is weak. Collaborative 
patents are also more frequent when the U.S.-based workforce of the firm
 has a strong ethnic component to it, reflective of global high-skilled 
migration. Collaborative patents tend to perform similarly to patents 
developed by the same companies using exclusively U.S.-based team, and 
both of these groups are stronger than those developed with exclusively 
foreign inventor teams.</div>

 ideal way to identify the consequences of foreign-born skilled labor 
flows would be to conduct an experiment in which the foreign workers are
 randomly assigned to some local labor markets but not to others. Causal
 wage and employment effects for natives could then be measured by 
comparing the outcomes of natives working in the “treated” markets that 
received foreign skilled workers to those working in “untreated” cities 
that did not. A similar experiment occurred in April of both 2007 and 
2008 when 65,000 H-1B skilled worker visas were randomly allocated to 
foreign applicants with job offers. About 88,000 requests for 
computer-related H-1B visas were not satisfied in each of those two 
years. In this analysis we track the consequences of this random 
negative H-1B supply shock on the employment and wages of natives across
 cities for computer-related occupations in 2009, 2010, and 2011. We 
find that in most cases negative H-1B shocks produced lower employment 
growth for native-born workers in the same labor market. This implies 
that H-1B workers do not displace but rather complement natives in 
computer-related occupations.</div>

 present empirical evidence that restrictions to the set of feasible 
financial contracts affect buyer - supplier relationships and the 
organizational form of the firm. We exploit a regulation change that 
restricted the maturity of the trade credit contracts that a large 
retailer could sign with its small suppliers, defined by an arbitrary 
sales cutoff, to at most 30 days. Using a within-product 
differences-in-differences identification strategy, we find that the 
restriction to the set of feasible contracts reduces the likelihood that
 trade takes place by 11%. The large retailer responds by internalizing 
the procurement of some products previously sold by affected firms to 
its own subsidiaries but reduces the volume of purchases, consistent 
with the fact that vertical integration is costly. Thus, financial 
contracts like trade credit may help overcome contracting frictions and 
enable trade.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13370_abstract">A
 randomized trial among dairy farmers in Kenya suggests that take up of 
loans to purchase rainwater harvesting tanks is highly sensitive to 
deposit and guarantor requirements. Only 2.4% of farmers took up loans 
to buy rainwater harvesting tanks under standard credit terms with high 
deposit and guarantor requirements. Giving farmers the opportunity to 
collateralize loans with the asset they purchase increased loan take up 
to 44%.  In contrast, substitution of joint liability guarantor 
requirements for deposit requirements does not increase loan take up.  
While easier credit terms are associated with higher rates of ever being
 late on a payment, late balances were trivial at the end of the sample,
 and we find neither selection or treatment effects of 25% deposit or 
guarantor requirements relative to a a 4% deposit requirement.  All 
loans were fully repaid (in one case out of the proceeds of a sale of a 
repossesed tank.)  Many borrowers repay loans early.  While we cannot 
rule out other hypotheses, the data are consistent with the hypothesis 
that farmers are loss averse and that asset-backed collateralization 
encourages investment by loss-averse agents.  Households offered loans 
on less restrictive terms are more likely to own a tank, have healthier 
cows, and report spending less time fetching water and tending 
livestock.  Girls in these households are more likely to be enrolled in 
school.</div>

 use detailed contract level data on a portfolio of 300 coffee 
processors in 25 developing countries to test for strategic default 
(ex-post moral hazard) in this market. Due to moral hazard, default 
rates increase following unanticipated increases in world coffee prices 
just before (but not just after) the maturity date of the contract.  
Contractual parties take into account strategic default in their 
contract choices: stronger relationships self-select into fixed price 
contracts that provide insurance to the seller but expose the buyer to 
strategic default. Weaker relationships self-select into indexed 
contracts that are robust to strategic default but left the exporter 
exposed to significant price risk. A RDD and model calibration shows 
that strategic default leads to credit constraints. Additional loans are
 used to increase input purchases from farmers rather than substituting 
other sources of credit. Prices paid to farmers increase implying the 
existence of contractual externalities along the supply chain.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13369_abstract">When
 contract enforcement is imperfect, concerns about ex-post reneging can 
lead to a break down in ex-ante trade. We study enforcement constraints 
in a setting with a high level of repeated interactions: irrigation 
sales among Indian farmers with neighboring landholdings. In this 
setting, smallholder farmers purchase irrigation from a well owner on a 
neighboring plot of land multiple times every year.  Using a field 
experiment, we offered to subsidize the cost of irrigation between 
potential water buyer and seller pairs, with the subsidy payment to be 
delivered three months in the future. We randomized whether this payment
 would be delivered into the hands of the water buyer, or directly into 
the hands of the water seller.  Under the Coasian benchmark, the amount 
of trade should not be affected by which party will receive our subsidy:
 if there are gains from trade, the parties should be able to execute 
the trade and ex ante agree on how to divide our payment.  However, 
consistent with enforcement constraints, when the parties know the money
 will be delivered directly to the water seller, the amount of 
irrigation is 27% higher and sellers extend trade credit 36% more often.
 This generates a 15% estimated increase in net revenues (crop yield 
revenue minus irrigation cost); this magnitude is equivalent to a 20% 
increase in land size.  These findings suggest that in our setting, 
contract enforceability is a first-order impediment to realizing the 
gains from trade</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11284_abstract">In
 recent years scholars in economics, psychology, and sociology have 
asserted that the “Easterlin Paradox” is not supported by their 
empirical research. The purpose of this paper is to test whether 
recently published data that provide longer time series confirm these 
negative findings. Is it “Paradox Lost”, or “Paradox Regained”?
 The Paradox states that at a point in time happiness varies directly 
with income both among and within nations, but over time happiness does 
not trend upward as income continues to grow.  There is no disagreement 
on the cross section relationship; the critical test of the Paradox is 
whether over time there is a statistically significant positive trend in
 happiness associated with long term economic growth. This paper tests 
for this association with new data (a) for the United States, and (b) 
the World Values Survey (WVS), the most widely used data source to test 
the Paradox.  
United States experience continues to support the Paradox: for almost 
seven decades, from 1946 through 2014, the trend in happiness has been 
flat, while real GDP per capita has tripled. The WVS data also support 
the Paradox: among countries worldwide there is not a statistically 
significant positive relationship between trends in happiness and real 
GDP per capita.  This nil relationship holds separately for developed, 
transition, and less developed countries. The WVS findings are the same 
after adjusting the data for changes over time in the happiness 
question, and eliminating outliers and countries with non-nationally 
representative surveys.  
Why have the Paradox critics come to different conclusions?  Among the 
reasons is that they typically use much shorter time series, misread the
 trend in transition countries, fail to take account of serious problems
 of data comparability, and dismiss tests of statistical significance.</div>

 records indicate that intergenerational mobility (IM) has been stable

using educational attainment as a proxy for adult income, stable IM is a
 new phenomenon: IM rose significantly for cohorts entering the labor 
market from 1940 to 1980. I measure IM directly in historical Census 
data for children still living with their parents at ages 22-25, and 
indirectly for other children using an imputation procedure that I 
validate in multiple data sets with parent-child links spanning the full
 1940-2000 period. Post-war mobility gains were much larger in the South
 and for blacks, and were driven by gains in high school rather than 
college enrollment. Controlling for region and year, states with higher 
IM have had lower income inequality, higher income levels, more 
educational inputs, higher minimum dropout ages, and lower teen birth 
rates. IM gains plausibly increased aggregate annual earnings growth by 
0.125-0.25 percentage points over the 1940-1980 period.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10831_abstract">As
 one of the most destructive civil conflicts in the history of 
contemporary China, the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) incentivized 
people to snitch on each other to signal their loyalty to Chairman Mao. 
To identify the causal effect of the exposure to Cultural Revolution on 
trusting outcomes, I take advantage of three sources of variation: (1) 
individual’s family origin during the CR (the Red, Middle or Black); (2)
 cohort exposure to the CR; and (3) regional variations on the intensity
 of the CR. The intensity measures include the number of deaths and 
struggle sessions normalized by population size on county level, 
constructed from the county gazetteers. The major finding is that 
individuals from counties with more conflicts and born in the era of CR 
are less trusting, and this effect is mainly driven by individuals from 
the Red and Black families. This suggests that both perpetrators and 
victims were hurt by the exposure to the Cultural Revolution. Robustness
 checks are conducted towards the reporting bias of the death and 
struggle sessions in local gazetteers and model specifications.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10825_abstract">The
 large and persistent current account surplus of China vis-a-vis the 
United States and Europe is surprising to many economists, but it is not
 historically unprecedented. It was also the case that during the early 
modern period (1500-1800) Asia, and in particular, China, ran an 
enormous current account surplus vis-a-vis Western Europe. In this paper
 we use a combination of empirical evidence and structural modeling in a
 contribution to understand the role of American precious metals in 
stimulating Euro-Asian trade during the early modern era. We estimate 
the size of injections to Europe's stock of precious metals and use this
 information in a dynamic general equilibrium model to reproduce 
observed history as well as calculate a no-shock counterfactual of not 
having the injection of precious metals. To do this, we take into 
account transaction costs and endogenous money demand. Precious metals 
were particularly important for Asia because there is evidence of 
scarcity of means of payments in this region. Our conclusion is that the
 discovery of a windfall of American precious metals was a major driving
 impulse behind early modern Euro-Asian trade. Under the monetary 
injection European purchases of Asian goods are four times those of the 
unshocked baseline scenario. The simulations further suggest most of the
 observed increase in Euro-Asian trade is explained by the monetary 
injections.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11544_abstract">The
 “staples thesis” argues that institutions in a given region could be 
explained by the nature of production of its prevailing staples, whereby
 slavery is likely to emerge in “slave-conducive” crops, such as cotton,
 rice, and sugarcane. This paper evaluates the thesis using a unique 
natural experiment from nineteenth-century rural Egypt, the cotton boom 
that occurred because of the American Civil War in 1861-1865. Historical
 evidence suggests that the cotton boom marked the emergence of the 
short-lived institution of large-scale agricultural slavery in Egypt’s 
Nile Delta, where all slaves were imported from East Africa, before the 
abolition of slavery in 1877. Employing the newly digitized Egyptian 
individual-level population census samples from 1848 and 1868, I find 
that cotton-favorable districts witnessed greater increases in 
household’s slaveholdings and the share of slave-owning households 
between 1848 and 1868 than less favorable districts. Those districts 
also witnessed greater increase in the population share of free local 
immigrants. I examine several potential mechanisms of these effects, 
namely, cross-district differences in the relative scarcity of free 
local labor and inter-crop differences in economies of scale and 
skill-intensity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12814_abstract">Despite
 well-documented large and growing returns to attending college, youth 
from disadvantaged backgrounds continue to attend college at lower rates
 than their advantaged peers. This gap is not fully explained by 
differences in academic preparation, and college enrollment and 
completion appear to have become more dependent on family income in 
recent decades. This paper reports the results of a randomized field 
trial of the effects of two variants of V-SOURCE, a college-counseling 
intervention designed to address informational and social support 
barriers to college enrollment, as well as students’ tendency to forget 
or procrastinate deadlines. V-SOURCE served students from the spring of 
the junior year through the summer after high school graduation. The 
program was delivered “virtually” via the internet, phone, email, text 
message, and social networking platforms, making it relatively low-cost 
and scalable. Although administrative and self-reported data reveal that
 students took advantage of V-SOURCE services and found them helpful, in
 preliminary analyses, we do not find evidence of effects of the program
 on college enrollment outcomes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12815_abstract">Governments
 spend heavily on public higher education to make college affordable. In
 2012, state appropriations to public colleges and universities exceeded
 $72 billion, allowing public institutions to keep college sticker 
tuition price lower for all students. Despite the magnitude of these 
expenditures, there exists little credible evidence on the causal impact
 of across-the-board tuition subsidies on college entry or college 
attainment. We exploit variation in tuition subsidies brought about by 
expansions in local college taxing district boundaries to isolate the 
impact of across-the-board tuition subsidies. Community college taxing 
districts are local jurisdictions that support public community 
colleges. In-district residents pay property taxes and face much lower 
tuition than individuals not living in college taxing districts. 
Preliminary event history analysis shows that Texas high school graduate
 cohorts exposed to taxing districts are more likely to attend community
 college immediately after high school compared to earlier cohorts of 
high school graduates from the same school district that are not 
exposed. The estimated effects are large, positive and statistically 
significant. Our effects are similar across students of varying economic
 status and measured ability. Moreover, we find little indication that 
students substitute away from public 4-year colleges. We are conducting 
analyses to distinguish between impacts of tuition subsidies and changes
 in college supply associated with taxing district expansions.</div>

 whether racial attitudes are malleable is critical for addressing the

general and are more likely to match with a black roommate the following
 year after reassignment to a new peer group with a different set of

 25 percent of college students currently participate in some type of

(MOOC) discussion forums, the primary setting for student-to-student and
 student-to-instructor online social interactions. We conduct a field 
experiment by posting comments using randomly assigned usernames in MOOC
 forums. Comments were randomly paired with a username evocative of 
race-gender profiles. We examine the number of views, responses, and 
points each comment receives. Our results indicate the presence of 
instructor bias. Instructors are more likely to respond to forum posts

 frequently propose to use capital tax reform to stimulate investment 
and increase labor earnings. This paper tests for such real impacts of 
the 2003 dividend tax cut—one of the largest reforms ever to a U.S. 
capital tax rate—using a quasi-experimental design and a large sample of
 U.S. corporate tax returns from years 1996-2008. I estimate that the 
tax cut caused zero change in corporate investment, with an upper bound 
elasticity with respect to one minus the top statutory tax rate of .08 
and an upper bound effect size of .03 standard deviations. This null 
result is robust across specifications, samples, and investment 
measures. I similarly find no impact on employee compensation. The lack 
of detectable real effects contrasts with an immediate impact on 
financial payouts to shareholders. Economically, the findings challenge 
leading estimates of the cost-of-capital elasticity of investment, or 
undermine models in which dividend tax reforms affect the cost of 
capital. Either way, it may be difficult for policymakers to implement 
an alternative dividend tax cut that has substantially larger near-term 
effects.</div>

 recommends aligning the tax treatment of debt and equity. A few 
countries, notably
Belgium, have introduced an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) to 
achieve tax neutrality. We
study the effects of adopting an ACE on debt financing, passive 
investment, and active investment of multinational firms, using 
high-quality administrative data on virtually all
German-based multinationals. We use two main identification strategies, 
based on: (1) synthetic
control methods, and (2) variations across affiliates within the 
multinational group. Our results
suggest that an ACE reduces the corporate debt ratio of multinational 
affiliates. Additionally, an ACE increases intra-group lending and other
 forms of passive investment but has no effects on
production investment of multinational affiliates. The findings indicate
 that a unilateral
implementation of an ACE system generates a tax planning opportunity 
using a structure
combining the benefits from the ACE with interest deductions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13254_abstract">The
 tax bias in favour of debt finance under the corporate income tax means
 that corporate debt ratios exceed the socially optimal level. This 
creates a rationale for thin-capitalization rules limiting the amount of
 debt that qualifies for interest deductibility. This paper sets up a 
model of corporate finance and investment in a small open economy to 
quantify the deadweight loss from the asymmetric tax treatment of debt 
and equity and to identify the second-best optimal debt-asset ratio in 
the corporate sector. For plausible parameter values derived from data 
for the Norwegian economy, the deadweight loss from the tax distortions 
to corporate financing decisions amounts to 2-3 percent of total 
corporate tax revenue, and the socially optimal debt-asset ratio is 4-5 
percentage points below the debt level currently observed. Driving the 
actual debt ratio down to this level would generate a total welfare gain
 of about 3 percent of corporate tax revenue. The welfare gain would 
arise partly from a fall in the social risks associated with corporate 
investment, and partly from the cut in the corporate tax rate made 
possible by a broader corporate tax base.</div>

 policy often uses subsidies to information or to capital in order to 
induce investment in more efficient energy-using durables, but there is 
little credible evidence on the efficacy of these policies. This paper 
reports on a large-scale field experiment that aimed to increase 
energy-efficiency, by providing energy audits and skilled energy 
managers, in a sample of 433 chemical and textile manufacturing plants 
in India. There are three main results. First, projected returns to 
energy efficiency in audited plants are high but rapidly diminishing. 
Second, treatment plants invest somewhat, but insignificantly, more than
 control plants in equipment upgrades and maintenance. In direct 
measurements of technical efficiency, treatment plants see improvements 
in certain aspects of thermal efficiency but no significant change in 
aggregate efficiency. Third, treatment plants see a short-lived and 
marginally significant decrease in electricity consumption after energy 
audits but return to the same consumption path as control plants within 
one year. The experiment does not support that subsidized information 
provision can reduce energy consumption.</div>

 efficiency programs are almost always evaluated by “engineering 
estimates” that may not align with empirically-realized energy savings 
and ignore non-monetary benefits and costs. We formalize a framework 
that uses engineering estimates and a refined set of revealed 
preferences to identify demand and market failure parameters for welfare
 analysis. We apply the framework to a 100,000-household randomized 
field experiment at a large energy efficiency program in Wisconsin. 
Energy use data suggest that the engineering estimates overstate 
realized energy savings over the first six to 18 months, and investment 
takeup data show substantial variation in non-monetary benefits and 
costs. Based only on monetary costs and benefits, the program had an 
internal rate of return of between -4.7 and 1.6 percent. Our welfare

 policy is increasingly focused on programs meant to counteract 
perceived underinvestment in energy efficiency. In evaluating these 
policies, economists have typically assumed that the actions of one 
household do not influence the choices of others. This misses a 
potentially important set of peer effects. If takeup of 
energy-efficiency programs is constrained by information problems, 
social networks may be particularly important in determining 
participation. In addition, correctly assessing the cost effectiveness 
of these programs requires credible estimates of spillover benefits. 
Taking advantage of rich household-level data on one million appliance 
replacements in a large middle-income country, I use a regression 
discontinuity design to compare homes whose neighbors were barely 
eligible for an appliance replacement subsidy to homes whose neighbors 
were barely ineligible. I find evidence of substantial peer effects. The

advantages. First, schools provide a rare laboratory to analyze energy

outdoor temperatures and with different existing infrastructures. 
Second, we make use of high frequency metering data---electricity 
consumption every fifteen minutes---to isolate times when measures are 
in use. These features allow us to precisely estimate the impacts of 
different types of energy efficiency measures, some of which are more 
capital intensive (appliance replacement) and some of which are more 
labor intensive (switching out lightbulbs). We then compare the 
estimates of the energy savings generated by measures to the costs of 
installing those measures to come up with measure-specific cost-benefit 
metrics. Finally, we consider whether the allocation of measures to

 it comes to the representation of women on boards, we argue that the 
finance industry may be special. Because it is relatively human capital 
intensive, educational differences between men and women may influence 
diversity in the industry. Since math is particularly important for 
finance, we examine this hypothesis using high school math scores from 
PISA. In countries with greater gender gaps in math scores and lower 
average math scores, we find that banks have lower boardroom diversity. 
The influence of math scores appears to transcend standard cultural 
explanations. Although special, the finance industry is not unique. Math
 scores also appear important for understanding boardroom diversity in 
other sectors. Our evidence suggests that differences in educational 
outcomes for boys and girls may have long-lasting implications for their
 career development.</div>

 paper studies the long run effects of financial crises using new bank 
and town level data from around the Great Depression. We find evidence 
that banking markets became much more concentrated in areas that 
experienced a greater initial collapse in the local banking system. 
These areas also suffered slower population growth and worse economic 
outcomes over the long run relative to towns that were less affected by 
the Great Depression. There is also evidence that  financial regulation 
after the Great Depression, and in particular limits on bank branching, 
may have helped to render the effects of the initial collapse 
persistent. All of this suggests a reason why post-crisis financial 
regulation, while potentially reducing financial instability, can also 
have longer run real consequences.</div>

 do banking crises end? Suppression of bank-specific information during 
the crisis and secrecy about the identities of emergency borrowers are 
essential ingredients. These policies focus attention on the banking 
system not individual banks. During the National Banking Era, 1863-1914,
 banks responded to panics by suspending convertibility of checks into 
cash. During suspension periods, the clearing house transformed itself 
into a single institution by issuing liabilities of the joint 
membership. As a single institution it would not allow members to 
publish their individual balance sheet information in newspapers, which 
was required in normal times. Only the aggregate clearing house 
information was published. The clearing house conducted some special 
examinations of member banks and bailed out some banks. Sometime later 
convertibility was resumed and bank-specific information was published 
again.</div>

 Federal Reserve System was established in 1914 to correct flaws in the 
U.S. banking system that reformers blamed for recurrent banking crises. 
Those flaws included “seasonal stringency” in financial markets; the 
concentration of the nation’s bank reserves in New York City and other 
financial centers; and reliance on interbank relationships to move funds
 geographically. In the 19th Century, an extensive interbank network 
evolved organically to move funds around the country to accommodate 
shifting demands for loans and cash, but the system failed to overcome 
fully the problems of seasonal stringency and “inelastic currency” that 
plagued the National Banking system and led to crises. In this paper, we
 document strong and somewhat regionally diverse seasonal patterns in 
interbank flows. The interbank market accommodated regional differences 
in the demands for money and credit by shifting funds from surplus to 
deficit regions, but broke down when shocks caused spikes in liquidity 
demand throughout the nation, as in 1893 and 1907. The Federal Reserve 
was structured in part to minimize the need for interregional flows of 
funds to smooth regional differences in money and credit demands. We 
find that interbank linkages diminished in importance after the Fed was 
established, but they did not disappear entirely. Although the Fed’s 
decentralized structure was successful in alleviating local seasonal 
stringencies, the structure likely made it more difficult for the System
 to respond effectively to prevent the national banking collapse of the 
1930s.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13051_abstract">The
 regulatory framework for commercial banks evolved over the 20th 
century. In the run up to the Great Depression capital requirements for 
commercial banks were fixed in dollar terms and bank owners and managers
 had substantial liability for the fate of their firms. In the run up to
 the Great Recession capital requirements were proportional to 
risk-weighted assets and bank owners and managers may have felt that 
some firm were too big to fail. We compare these two regimes by 
examining historical and modern micro data and comparing the behavior of
 large and small institutions. We document how the largest banks’ 
capital choices in these two regimes differed during the two largest 
financial booms and busts in American history. Our findings illuminate 
the impact of changes in the regulatory framework on the behavior of the
 largest financial institutions in the U.S. Our empirical results 
suggest that the pre-Great Depression regulatory regime would have 
induced the largest U.S. banks to hold greater capital buffers prior to 
the financial crisis of 2008.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10267_abstract">Public
 questioning about the role of finance has been fueled by the perception
 that financial sector pay is an important factor behind high economic 
inequalities. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive 
analysis of the level of earnings in finance and the implications for 
labor income inequality for 18 European countries. Financial sector 
workers are shown to make up 20% among the top 1% earners, although the 
overall employment share of finance is only 4%. Nonetheless, the 
relatively small size of the sector limits the contribution that 
financial sector pay has on income inequality to a small, but noticeable
 amount. Simulations indicate that most of this contribution is 
explained by financial institutions paying salaries and bonuses which 
are above what employees with similar profiles receive in other sectors.
 Estimations that allow for heterogeneity across workers reveal that 
this wage premium is more than twice as high for financial sector 
workers at the top of the earnings distribution than at the bottom.</div>

 but much remains to be learned about their socio-demographic 
characteristics. This paper is the first study to provide a 
comprehensive look at the profiles of the 1% highest paid employees 
across 18 European countries. Estimations use the largest harmonized 
data set available, an employer-based survey with a sample for the top 
1% of 100,000. Workers in the top 1% tend to: i) be in their 40s or 50s,
 ii) be a man, iii) have tertiary education, iv) work in finance, 
manufacturing or wholesale and retail, and v) be employed as chief 
executives or other senior managers. These patterns are broadly similar 
across countries, but the analysis also uncovers several cross-country 
differences. For example, top earners are younger in Eastern Europe, 
they are less often new recruits in Southern Europe, and they include 
more women in countries where overall female employment is higher.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11931_abstract">We
 study optimal capital-income taxation when people are heterogeneous 
with respect to the rate of return they obtain on their investments. 
Such heterogeneity can be caused by some people having access to closely
 held investment opportunities that yield superior earnings, or by 
people having better access to financial markets than others. We show 
that this invalidates the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem which states that a 
capital-income tax is not a useful supplement of a nonlinear income tax 
if preferences are weakly separable between consumption and labor. We 
find two distinct reasons why capital-income taxes are desirable when 
people face different rates of return: one redistributional reason, and 
one efficiency reason.

First, if people with the same labor income receive a different income 
from capital, government should tax capital income for redistributive 
purposes. After all, people with high capital income consume more and 
thus have a lower marginal utility of income. Moreover, such 
redistribution can never take place through the use of labor income 
taxation since these people are identical with respect to labor income.

Second, assuming that people are heterogeneous with respect to both 
their wage income and their return to capital, there is an additional 
efficiency reason to tax capital income if returns to capital are 
positively correlated with people's wages. If that is the case, a 
capital tax needs to tax away less of the previously earned wage income 
than does the labor-income tax, for a given redistributive gain. 
Capital-income taxes are therefore less distortive of labor supply and 
optimally supplement the labor income tax.

We provide formulas for the optimal capital-income tax, expressed in 
terms of empirically measurable sufficient statistics, including 
elasticities for the labor-income and capital-income tax bases, people's
 marginal propensity to save, the extent of heterogeneity of returns to 
capital, and the correlation between returns and wages.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11202_abstract">Increasing
 inequality in recent decades has triggered a heated debate on whether 
wealth transfer taxation is an appropriate countermeasure to the 
perpetuation of inequality. A major factor in making progress in this 
discussion is understanding how taxpayers respond to incentives 
generated by wealth transfer taxes. Using administrative tax records 
from Germany, this paper investigates behavioral responses to a very 
large transfer tax kink in the inheritance and inter vivos gift tax 
schedule. We find sharp bunching of taxable inheritances and even larger
 bunching of taxable inter vivos gifts. However, because the kink is 
large, the underlying taxable inheritance and gift elasticities are 
moderate and amount up to 0.11. In line with the notion of accidental 
bequest models, further evidence suggests that the amount of wealth 
bequeathed is uncertain. This may explain the small size of the 
inheritance elasticities. Based on the results, the present paper lends 
strong support to the hypothesis that wealth transfers are relatively 
inelastic along the intensive margin in the short term.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11116_abstract">We
 study the effects on inequality of a "Piketty transition" to zero 
growth.  In a model with a worker-capitalist dichotomy, we show first 
that the relationship between inequality (measured as a ratio of incomes
 for the two types) and growth depends critically upon the elasticity of
 substitution in production. For nearly all elasticity values, long run 
inequality is lower under zero growth.  Although under zero growth 
capitalists save more, factor prices respond to the relative of 
abundance of capital, decreasing the return to capital relative to 
wages, which mitigates inequality. Extending our model to include 
idiosyncratic wage risk we show that growth has quantitatively 
negligible effects on inequality, and again the effect is negative 
rather than positive.  Finally, following Piketty's thought experiment, 
we study how the transition might occur without declining returns; here,
 we find inequality decreases substantially if financial innovation acts
 to reduce idiosyncratic return risk, and does not change much at all if
 it acts to increase capital's share of income.</div>

 study the effects of trade integration for the conduct of monetary 
policy in a two-country model with heterogeneous firms, endogenous 
producer entry, and labor market frictions. The model reproduces 
important empirical regularities related to international trade, namely 
synchronization of business cycles across trading partners and 
reallocation of market shares across producers. When trade linkages are 
weak, the optimal cooperative policy is inward-looking and requires 
significant departures from price stability both in the long run and 
over the business cycle. As trade integration reallocates market share 
toward more productive firms, the need of positive inflation to correct 
long-run distortions is reduced. Moreover, increased business cycle 
synchronization implies that country-specific shocks have more global 
consequences. As a result, the optimal cooperative policy remains inward
 looking. However, sub-optimal domestic stabilization implies 
inefficient fluctuations in cross-country demands that result in larger 
welfare costs when trade linkages are strong.</div>

 paper develops a framework to study how different sources of 
fluctuations and the micro-structure of trade networks shape the 
volatility of exports at the firm-level and in the aggregate. We 
consider four orthogonal shocks affecting exporter-importer trade 
networks -- a macroeconomic shock and three individual shocks hitting 
respectively the exporter, its foreign partner, and the match they form.
 We use our framework and new data on networks connecting French 
exporters to European buyers over the 1995-2007 period to structurally 
estimate these shocks. Individual shocks are found to be a major source 
of fluctuations, in disaggregated as in aggregate data. Customer-related
 shocks matters for the volatility in the small. Firms' exposure to such
 shocks varies depending on the structure of their portfolio of 
customers: More diversified firms are better hedged against 
customer-related shocks. This diversification explains a sizable 
fraction of the dispersion of volatility across firms. In the aggregate,
 the relative prevalence of different types of individual shocks also 
varies across countries. We show that it depends on the shape of the 
sales distribution across sellers, buyers and seller-buyer pairs. 
Differences in the structure of trade networks partly explains the 
differences in the origins and the magnitude of the volatility of French
 exports across destinations.</div>

 current account deficits of Spain, Portugal and Greece are the result 
of large deficits in goods trade and modest surpluses in service trade. 
Germany, instead, displays a large surplus in goods trade, but a deficit
 in service trade. Starting from this motivating evidence, I propose in 
this paper a simple model that rationalizes how the asymmetric timing of
 trade liberalizations can affect current account dynamics. I solve 
analytically a log-linear version of the model and derive an expression 
where the current account depends on present and future relative changes
 in the exogenous trade costs. Second, I show that trade costs dynamics 
and productivity dynamics have been highly asymmetric in the 
manufacturing and services sectors in Germany in the period 2000-2007 
and I propose a quantitative analysis based on a standard 2-country 
international real business cycle model augmented with trade costs. When
 fed with the actual asymmetric trends found in the German data, the 
model can generate a trade surplus of about 6% of GDP. The model 
delivers large trade surpluses also when considering only asymmetric 
trade liberalizations, but fails to generate surpluses consistent with 
the data when considering only asymmetric productivity dynamics. 
Finally, I provide empirical evidence broadly supporting the key 
predictions of the simple model using both data from 24 OECD countries 
plus the BRICS and data from a sample of developing countries 
specialized in the export of agricultural goods.</div>

contribute their own strengths to the fulfillment of the project. Such 
interactions among collaborators can stimulate creative thinking and 
provide learning opportunities for those who lack certain skills. 
Therefore, it is intuitive to expect that the quality of a researcher’s 
collaborators has a positive effect on her own productivity, which is 
the main hypothesis to be tested in this study. To obtain a causal 
relationship, we address the endogeneity issue from people’s selection 
in collaborators by estimating pairwise network formations in the first 
step. Identification comes from exclusive variables that affect a 
researcher’s choice of collaborators but not her productivity directly. 
These instruments include network structure measures (such as degree 
centrality and eigenvector centrality) of a researcher’s collaborators. 
They impact the researcher’s probability to meet potential collaborators
 but are excluded from her own research output equation because they are
 the characteristics of her collaborators rather than that of herself.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11274_abstract">The
 paper studies empirically the structure and dynamics of the networks of
 exchanges in rural communities of the Gambia, West Africa. We build the
 analysis on two rounds of data collection, in 2009 and 2014, in 56 
Gambian villages.  In each of these villages we interviewed all 
households (with few missing observations), collecting data for 8 
different economic (e.g., for land, labor and credit) and social (family
 and friendship) networks. Our data combines two special features: By 
collecting data on all households, we avoid the biases of network 
analyses that are based on samples of households (e.g., Chandrasekhar 
and Lewis, 2011). In addition, half of our villages were treated with a 
randomly placed Community-Driven Development (CDD) program in 2009/10, 
after the baseline data collection, providing an exogenous source of 
variation in village-level development opportunities and in the 
structure of social interactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We contribute to the literature in two directions. First, our data on 
networks at two points in time allows us a rare glimpse at how networks 
evolve over time. Second, we exploit the random placement of the CDD 
program as an exogenous shock to networks. The program is designed to 
affect the structure of interactions within the villages, with a 
particular focus on inclusiveness and avoiding elite capture. To analyze
 the causal mechanisms behind the dynamics of economic exchanges in the 
Gambian villages, we employ a difference-in-difference estimator, to 
study network-related outcomes at the village-, household- and at the 
dyadic-level. A particular focus is on the question whether evidence for
 the intended change in village-level institutions (e.g., Casey et al. 
2012) can be found in networks; in particular, we investigate how the 
networks of village elites (such as traditional chiefs or religious 
leaders) and the networks of households that were isolated at baseline 
change in response to the program.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10730_abstract">Empirical
 research on social and economic networks has been constrained by the 
limited availability of data regarding such networks. This paper 
develops a method that does not rely on network data to estimate network
 effects. The proposed method also estimates the probability that pairs 
of individuals form connections, which may depend on exogenous factors 
such as common gender. The method may incorporate imperfect network 
data, such as with self-reported data, with the purpose of refining the 
estimates and testing whether the reported connections positively affect
 the probability that a link is formed. To achieve those goals, I derive
 a maximum likelihood estimator for network effects that is not 
conditioned on network observation. Networks are treated as a source of 
unobserved heterogeneity and eliminated based on data collected from 
observing many groups. This is accomplished with recourse to a spatial 
econometric model with unobserved and stochastic networks. I then apply 
the model to estimate network effects in the context of a program 
evaluation. I demonstrate theoretically and empirically that including 
network effects has important implications for policy assessments.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10640_abstract">We
 investigate whether small societies that are largely self-reliant for 
risk sharing and investment, and are suddenly exposed to an external 
source of credit, experience changes in internal social network 
structure.  We examine not only whether such exposure changes the 
internal borrowing and lending structure of a society, but also whether 
this spills over and affects other networks such as exchange of favors 
and advice.  We first provide a theoretical framework for analyzing how 
informal borrowing and lending relationships interact with exchange of 
favors and advice.  We show that these are strategic complements and 
that eliminating some borrowing and lending relationships decreases the 
number of favor and advice relationships, and also results in a network 
that has a lower local clustering measure (`support').   We then 
investigate this empirically,  using our data from 
\citep*{banerjeecdj2013} augmented with a resurvey after exposure to 
microfinance.   Our data include detailed social network data on 75 
villages, predating the entry of a microfinance institution; as well 
detailed social network data in the same villages two years {\sl after} 
the entry of the microfinance organization. Most importantly, the MFI  
entered just over half of the villages and not the others, allowing us 
to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis.  We find that villages 
that were exposed to microfinance not only see a significant loss in the
 average number of borrowing and lending relationships compared to 
villages that were not exposed, but also see a significant loss in the 
number of favor exchange and advice relationships.  In addition, 
exposure to formal borrowing channels changes the structure of the 
social network resulting in people having significantly fewer `friends 
in common', beyond what would come directly from the decreased density.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14339_abstract">Productivity
 measures are critical for understanding economic growth and business 
survival in the U.S. economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
produces the official productivity statistics for the U.S. using 
aggregate industry level data. However, those statistics cannot provide 
insight on the within-industry variation in productivity, limiting our 
understanding of the rich productivity dynamics in the U.S. economy. To 
address this gap, the BLS and the Census Bureau are collaborating to 
create measures of within-industry productivity dispersion with the goal
 of developing both public-use and restricted-use statistics. The 
public-use measures of productivity dispersion will include 
within-industry measures of the distribution of productivity for 
industries in the Manufacturing sector and will be published jointly by 
the BLS and the Census Bureau. Restricted-use establishment-level data 
with input, output, and productivity measures will be made available in 
secure Federal Statistical Research Data Centers. 
Why do we need measures of within-industry productivity dispersion? 
Results from microdata-based productivity research have changed the way 
we think about aggregate productivity growth, labor market dynamics, 
international trade and industrial organization. There are large and 
persistent productivity differences across businesses even within 
narrowly defined industries.  These differences are correlated with 
important economic outcomes such as the growth and survival of 
establishments. 
In this paper, we construct establishment-level labor productivity and 
multifactor productivity measures using microdata from the Annual Survey
 of Manufactures and the Census of Manufactures. Along the way, we 
examine a variety of data and measurement issues including issues 
related to imputation and weighting of the microdata. We also compare 
industry-level micro-aggregated measures to BLS industry-level measures 
of inputs, output and productivity.  Finally, we explore the variation 
in our industry-level productivity dispersion measures across industries
 and time.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14340_abstract">The
 notion that firms provide wage insurance to risk-averse workers goes 
back to Bailey (1975).  Recently, Guiso et al. (2005) use Italian data 
and find evidence of full wage insurance in the case of temporary shocks
 to firm output, although only partial insurance for permanent shocks.  
Using 1992-2011 Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data 
matched to Census annual business surveys, we examine whether shocks to 
firm performance (year to year changes in sales and value-added) are 
transmitted to worker earnings.  We examine both short-term (year to 
year) and long-term (five year) changes, using Economic Census data to 
examine the representativeness of our annual sample.  We also examine 
whether the extent of wage insurance varies across industries and 
workers at different percentiles in the earnings distribution.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14341_abstract">A
 large empirical literature has documented the existence of 
establishment wage differentials. But worker and establishment 
differentials are typically identified via turnover, which means that it
 is not possible to know very much about what these effects represent or
 how persistent they are over time.
We use a largely untapped dataset, the BLS’s Occupational Employment 
Statistics, to examine the nature of establishment wage differentials. 
The OES is an establishment survey that collects payroll information 
(i.e., the employment and wages for each occupation) for a relatively 
large number (about 400,000 per year) of establishments across the 
United States. This information allows us to identify and estimate 
occupation-by-establishment wage differentials, expressed as the percent
 difference between the prevailing wage in the market for an occupation 
and the wage paid by the establishment. We then aggregate these 
differentials to calculate establishment-specific wage differentials. 
With these establishment-specific differentials in hand, we can examine 
their properties and determine the extent to which they persist over 
time. 
We first examine the distribution of wage differentials across 
establishments and how the magnitudes of these effects vary by 
establishments’ observable characteristics, such as industry, size, 
skill intensity. Next, we examine how these differentials are 
distributed across occupations within each establishment. If they are 
unequally distributed, then it would be hard to argue that they are true
 establishment wage differentials. Existing research (Lane, Salmon, and 
Spletzer 2007) has shown that there is a positive correlation between 
the wages of certain high-wage and low-wage pairs of occupations. For 
example, establishments that pay high wages to accountants also pay high
 wages to janitors. Our methodology allows us to use standard inequality
 measures to examine the within establishment distribution of these 
differentials, and relate them to observable characteristics. Finally, 
we examine the persistence of establishment wage differentials for a 
sample of large certainty units that are in the OES sample in multiple 
years.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14342_abstract">Recent
 work highlights the importance of the establishment where someone works
 in the pay of workers and in the growth in wage inequality among US 
workers (Barth, Bryson, Davis, and Freeman 2014).  To what extent are 
differences in earnings linked to the firm to which the establishment 
belongs and its characteristics, and to the characteristics of the 
establishment, in addition to the characteristics of the individual that
 enters the standard earnings equation? 
To answer this question we combine establishment level data with data on
 firms (using firm identifiers on the establishment files) and data on 
employees (using establishment identifiers linked to the Longitudinal 
Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD)) to estimate earnings equations that 
include establishment and firm characteristics.  
We measure establishment-level characteristics by: the value of capital 
structures from buildings to equipment of different types from the 
quinquennial Economic Census from 1992 to 2007; and the average of years
 of schooling, age, gender, race at the establishment level obtained 
from the characteristics of individual workers in the establishment in 
the decennial Census long forms for 2000 and 1990, and CPS for 
1986-1998.   
We measure firm-level characteristics by R&amp;D investments from the 
Business R&amp;D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) and different forms of 
capital investments from the Annual Capital Expenditure Survey (ACES).  
We link these firm-level characteristics to the LEHD, thus adding 
measures of the knowledge and physical capital of the firm to workers 
wage regressions. 
Decomposing the variance of ln earnings of individuals, we find that 
both firm and establishment substantially affect the variation of 
earnings of workers, along with their individual characteristics. At the
 establishment level, the education of co-workers affects individual 
pay, conditional on own level of education; plant capital equipment is 
associated with higher wages whereas building structures have little 
effect.  The firm's level of R&amp;D intensity is associated with higher
 wages for all workers. These results hold both when workers move to 
establishments or firms with larger amounts of the specified attributes 
and when they remain at the same establishment and the establishment or 
firm increases the attributes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11989_abstract">A
 multi-agent dynamic game of experimentation is examined where players 
non-cooperatively search for a common unknown threshold. Time is 
discrete and players take turns in adjusting their individual level of 
performance. There is assumed to be a common threshold of performance 
below which a player suffers a (lump sum) cost of breakdown. Information
 is shared by all, and players start with a common prior with regard to 
the distribution of the threshold.

For time intervals that are sufficiently short, there always exists a 
symmetric pure-strategy MPE. Closed-form descriptions are obtained for 
equilibrium strategy, value, and time path of performance level in the 
limit as the period length tends to zero. In equilibrium, learning is 
gradual and eventual learning is not guaranteed. There is an asymptotic 
level towards which the time path of performance settles in the long run
 provided that no breakdown occurs, and hence learning diminishes 
overtime, leaving a safety margin with no more decline in performance. 
The dynamics of the multi-agent game pose a sharp contrast to those of a
 single-agent decision problem, because in the latter, the level of 
performance declines to the asymptotic level almost instantly when the 
time interval is short. The decline in performance is robust to 
different move structures of the game, and to different cost structure 
of a breakdown. The decline is slower with more players.</div>

 mechanisms eliminate the possibility for gain from strategic 
misrepresentation of preferences. If market participants respond 
optimally, these mechanisms permit the observation of true preferences

 paper studies bilateral trading in divisible double auctions.  In the 
existing literature, divisible double auctions have been applied 
predominantly to markets with at least three bidders, for the reason 
that the usual linear equilibrium implies a market breakdown if only two
 bidders are present.  These models thus cannot describe important 
decentralized markets where trades are conducted bilaterally (i.e. with 
exactly two agents).  Examples include the bilateral trading of 
commodities, financial securities, and derivatives.  In this paper we 
fill this gap.  In our model, two bidders trade a divisible asset in a 
double auction.  The bidders (1) submit demand schedules, (2) have 
interdependent and linearly decreasing or constant marginal values, and 
(3) can be asymmetric in their preferences.  We characterize a family of
 nonlinear equilibria, implicitly given by a solution to an algebraic 
equation.  These equilibria are also ex post optimal, that is, bidders 
do not wish to change their strategies even after they observe the 
equilibrium outcome ex post.  If marginal values are constant, we solve 
the family of ex post equilibria in closed form.  We show that the 
equilibrium quantity of trading is strictly less than that in the ex 
post efficient allocation.  Our theory of bilateral trading differs from
 the bargaining literature and can serve as a tractable building block 
to model dynamic trading in decentralized markets of divisible assets.</div>

 paper studies the design of reverse auctions in the US incentive 
auctions where TV broadcasters in the UHF band offer to relinquish the 
usage right or to relocate to another band to increase the spectrum for 
mobile communication uses. The state of the art is the 
deferred-acceptance auctions by Milgrom and Segal (2014) that determine 
allocations based on scores and are strategy-proof when sellers are 
single-minded. But when sellers have multiple relinquishment options and
 are restricted to be single-minded, there would be possibilities of 
strategic considerations about which option the seller should bid. 
Nevertheless just allowing multiple bids is not possible since a seller 
switching one option to another may violate interference constraints. To
 resolve this issue, this paper proposes generalized deferred acceptance
 auctions with the supplementary phase where sellers make multiple 
offers, the buyer does not need to recalculate interference constraints,
 and are strategy-proof. This auction can be regarded as a 
generalization of `ladder auctions' of Milgrom, Ausubel, Levin, and 
Segal (2014) for multiple offers. These results show generalities and 
robustness of incentive auctions design described in FCC (2015)and 
Milgrom and Segal (2014).</div>

 examine the long-term effects of improved agricultural productivity on

dataset on the location of conflicts in Europe, Middle East and North 
Africa between 1400 and 1900. Exploiting the improvement in agricultural
 productivity arising from the introduction of potatoes from the 
Americas in the late 17th century, we compare the prevalence of 
conflicts in regions suitable for potato cultivation with the prevalence
 in unsuitable regions, before and after potatoes were introduced. Our 
results show that the increase in agricultural productivity arising from
 the introduction of potatoes significantly reduced conflict. We find 
that this occurred through a reduction in the onset of conflicts rather 
than through a shortening of the duration of conflicts. We also find 
that the increase in agricultural productivity resulted in the formation
 of larger states with control over larger amounts of land.</div>

 in climate have been shown to substantially shape intergroup violence, 
but the mechanism remains poorly understood. We test if economic factors
 are the central pathway by examining killings by drug-trafficking

temperatures have a large and similar impact on all three types of 
violence, suggesting some commonality in mechanisms. Many patterns in

 study whether war service by one generation affects service by the next
 generation in later wars, in the context of the major U.S. theaters of 
the 20th century. To identify a causal effect, we exploit the fact that 
general suitability for service implies that the closer to age 21 an 
individual’s father happened to be at a time of war is a key determinant
 of the father’s likelihood of participation. We find that a father’s 
war service has a positive and significant effect on his son’s 
likelihood of service in the next generation’s war. Across all wars, we 
estimate an intergenerational transmission parameter of approximately 
0.1. Quantitatively, our estimates imply that each individual war had a 
substantial impact on service in those that followed. This effect cannot
 be explained by broader occupational choice or labor market opportunity
 channels: father’s war service increases sons’ educational achievement 
and actually reduces the likelihood of military service outside of 
wartime. Instead, we find evidence consistent with cultural transmission
 from fathers to sons. Taken together, our results indicate that a 
history of wars helps countries overcome the collective action problem

 Earth system may react in a nonlinear threshold response to climate 
forcings.  One such example is the potential disintegration of the West 
Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) in response to ocean and atmospheric warming,
 leading to substantial sea-level rise.  WAIS disintegration has been 
interpreted as an example of dangerous anthropogenic interference with 
the climate system and been discussed as one motivation for stringent 
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.  Incorporating threshold 
responses into integrated assessment models (IAMs) used for policy 
analysis poses nontrivial challenges due to the current incomplete 
scientific understanding, methodological limitations, and pervasive deep
 uncertainties.  Here we analyze the effects of representing (in a very 
approximate way) a potential WAIS disintegration in a stochastic 
programming IAM with endogenous uncertainty.  We identify methodological
 and conceptual challenges and demonstrate avenues to address some of 
them through model emulation as well as the representation of expert 
knowledge, and learning.  The results illustrate the relationships 
between scientific uncertainties, policy objectives, and metrics such as
 the social cost of carbon.  We conclude with a discussion of key open 
challenges and research needs.</div>

increases, capital inflows decrease and capital outflows increase. We

 country-specific volatility. Capital inflows respond to both systematic

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20298_abstract">This
 paper looks into the so-called "revolving door of Washington", which is
 the movement of individuals between federal government positions and 
jobs in the private sector, and examines how it affects long-run stock 
returns. The equally-weighted portfolio of firms where current public 
officials become future employees outperforms the equally-weighted 
portfolio of remaining firms by a highly statistically significant 7.43%
 per year in terms of four-factor alpha. Our results are robust to 
different weighting methodologies and risk adjustments, and we present 
results against potential reverse causality arguments. To give an 
economic explanation to this outperformance, we show that firms receive 
more government contracts from a government agency when a future firm 
employee is holding a post at that agency. Financial gains from these 
contracts are economically large, and these gains are significantly 
reduced during periods in which presidential executive orders restrict 
revolving door movements. Our results are consistent with the notion 
that some public officials could be favoring certain companies while in 
office with a view to gaining future corporate employment.</div>

Using confidential regulatory data on daily repo transactions from July 
2008 to July 2014, I show that non-US banks continue to remove an 
average of $170 billion from the US tri-party repo market every 
quarter-end. This amount is more than double the$76 billion market-wide 
drop in tri-party repo during the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis 
and represents about 10% of the entire tri-party repo market. Window 
dressing induced deleveraging spills over into agency bond markets and 
money market funds and affects market quality each quarter, and 
understates balance sheet based measures of systemic risk for non-US 
banks.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21429_abstract">When
 students fund their education through loans, changes in student 
borrowing and tuition are interlinked. Tuition cost impacts loan demand 
but loan supply can also affects equilibrium tuition costs when students
 are constrained in their borrowing. To resolve this simultaneity 
problem, we exploit unique student loan data and policy changes  in the 
Stafford Loan Program over the past few years, as a natural experiment, 
to identify the impact of an increase in the student loan supply on 
changes in tuition. Our results indicate that institutions more exposed 
to changes in  borrowing limits of federal loan programs raise their 
tuition disproportionately around these policy changes. These effects 
are most pronounced for expensive, private institutions that are also 
not among the most selective as measured by average student SAT scores. 
We also find evidence of larger tuition increases around changes in the 
Stafford Loan Program for private for-profit institutions.</div>

 Regulation often mandates increased transparency to improve how well 
prices reflect fundamentals. We show that such policy can be 
counterproductive. We study the optimal decision of an investor who can 
choose to acquire costly information not only about asset fundamentals 
but also about the behavior of liquidity traders. We characterize how 
changing the cost of information acquisition affects the extent to which
 prices reflect fundamentals. When liquidity trading is price-dependent 
(e.g., due to forced deleveraging), surprising results emerge: higher 
transparency, even if exclusively targeting fundamentals, can decrease 
price informativeness, and cheaper access to non-fundamental information
 can improve efficiency. </div>

 study a dynamic market where competitive, risk-averse fast dealers or 
high frequency traders (HFTs) together with standard (slow) dealers 
provide liquidity to a population of hedgers with heterogeneous 
investment horizons. Long term hedgers hold their position until the 
liquidation date, whereas short term ones unwind at interim. This setup 
generates endogenous persistence of liquidity shocks, liquidity 
complementarities, and potential multiple equilibria with different 
levels of liquidity. This can explain liquidity fragility and “flash 
crashes.” We use our model to assess the impact of HFT on market quality
 and traders’ welfare. Liquidity complementarities can make liquidity 
decreasing in the mass of HFTs, notwithstanding that an increase in HFT 
enhances the risk-bearing capacity of the market. Furthermore, 
equilibria with high liquidity are not necessarily associated with 
higher welfare. Finally, we endogenize the number of HFTs, and show that
 the solution chosen by a monopolistic exchange is generally at odds 
with the one advocated by a social planner.</div>

 recent years, technological innovations and changes in financial 
regulation induced a new set of liquidity providers to arise on 
financial markets: high-frequency traders (HFTs). HFTs differ most 
notably from traditional market participants in the fact that they 
combine speed and information processing. We compare a setting with HFTs
 to settings with traders that only have speed technology or only 
information processing technology available. Speed technology by itself 
will only be adopted when socially efficient. Information processing 
technology by itself will only generate mild inefficiencies due to a 
lemons problem. The combination of the two, however, can lead to the 
implementation of inefficient speed technology or the amplification of 
the lemons problem. In the latter case, liquidity evaporates when it is 
most needed and markets can freeze altogether for periods of time. We 
also discuss how regulation can prevent such sudden drops of liquidity 
and how the market may recover after a freeze.</div>

 paper examines the relation between high-frequency trading (HFT) and 
extreme price movements (jumps). Some market observers allege that HFT 
exacerbates or even causes price jumps, thus contributing to market 
instability. Contrary to these allegations, we find that during extreme 
price movements high-frequency traders act as net liquidity suppliers, 
while non-high-frequency traders act as net liquidity demanders. 
Moreover, high-frequency traders are active liquidity providers during 
price jumps that result in permanent price changes, absorbing the most

 show that household investment decisions depend on the manner in which 
information is displayed by exploiting a regulatory change which 
prohibited the display of past returns for any period shorter than 
twelve months. In this setting, the information displayed was altered 
but the attainable information set remained constant. Using a 
differences-in-differences design, I find that the shock to information 
display caused a reduction in the sensitivity of fund flows to 
short-term returns, a decline in overall trade volume, and increased 
asset allocation toward riskier funds. These results are consistent with
 models of limited attention and myopic loss aversion. To further 
explore the concept of salience, I propose a distinction between 
relative and absolute salience and find evidence consistent with the 
latter. Overall, my findings indicate that small changes in the manner 
in which past performance information is displayed can have large 
effects on household investment behavior and potentially influence 
households’ accumulated wealth at retirement.</div>

 paper exploits a natural experiment to document adverse selection among
 prime consumer credit borrowers in the US. In our setting, some 
borrowers are offered only a short term loan while an observationally 
equivalent set of borrowers is offered the same short term loan as well 
as an additional long maturity option. We isolate adverse selection from
 the causal effect of maturity on repayment by comparing the ex post 
default behavior of borrowers who took the same short term loan in both 
settings. We show that when the long term option is available, borrowers
 who choose the short term loan default less and have higher future FICO
 scores. Thus, a longer loan maturity induces adverse selection by 
attracting unobservably less creditworthy borrowers. The difference in 
the default rate of borrowers who choose the pre-existing short maturity
 loan and those that self select to the new long maturity option is five
 percentage points, an economically large effect for prime borrowers 
whose average default rate is 8.6%. Our results highlight the potential 
for underprovision of long maturity consumer credit.</div>

 look at the supply side of the credit card market to analyze the 
pricing and advertising strategies of credit card offers. We show that 
credit cards which have reward programs have lower regular APR but rely 
more heavily on backward loaded and more hidden payment features such as
 late fees, default APR or over limit fees. Issuers target different 
reward programs at different types of the population: Programs such as 
miles, cash back and points are offered to richer and more educated 
customers, while low intro APR offers are offered to poorer and less 
educated customers. The results support the idea put forward in models 
of behavioral contract theory that credit card companies use reward 
programs to either shroud aspects of a card offer or exploit their time 
inconsistency. Our results also suggest that card features that are 
mainly demanded by sophisticated consumers cannot be shrouded and need 
to be priced upfront. Finally, using shocks to the credit worthiness of 
customers via increases in state level unemployment insurance, we show 
that card issuers rely more heavily on backward loaded credit terms when
 customers are more protected.</div>

 donors choose to contribute to endowment if they want to make a 
permanent contribution to the university. It is consequently viewed as a
 responsibility of the university to preserve capital when choosing the 
investments and spending rule of endowments. Practitioners commonly 
measure preservation of capital by looking at the excess of expected 
return over the spending rate, but this criterion involves an incorrect 
application of the law of large numbers based on products instead of 
sums. The measure can be corrected by looking expected log return net of
 spending, which is less by approximately half the variance of returns 
if period returns are not too volatile. Even if the correct minimum 
spending rule is applied, the common practice of smoothing spending 
using a partial adjustment model for spending tends to makes spending 
unstable in bad times and in fact the probability of eventual ruin is

 offer a simple portfolio choice-based rationale for the documented 
failure of institutional investors to trade against mispricing. In a 
dynamic model where an informed and risk-averse money manager faces 
convex (i.e., option-like) incentives, we show that the standard 
mean-variance and hedging components that make up the portfolio often 
imply opposite stances against mispricing. The first component 
represents the manager's bets against overpriced securities. By 
contrast, the manager's hedge against the risk of forfeiting an 
end-of-period performance fee can result in substantial over-investment 
in overpriced securities. This ``bubble-riding'' component is more 
likely to drive the manager's portfolio as overpricing increases.

 assets, such as private equity, hedge funds, and real assets, are 
illiquid and opaque, and thus pose a challenge to traditional models of 
asset allocation. In this paper, we study asset allocation and asset 
pricing in a general equilibrium model with liquid assets and an 
alternative risky asset, which is opaque and incurs transaction costs, 
and investors who differ in their experience in assessing the 
alternative asset. We find that the optimal asset-allocation strategy of
 the relatively inexperienced investors is to initially tilt their 
portfolio away from the alternative asset and to hold more of it with 
experience. Counterintuitively, a decrease in the transaction cost for 
the alternative asset increases the portfolio tilt at the initial date, 
and hence, the liquidity discount. Transaction costs may induce 
inexperienced investors to hold a majority of the illiquid asset at 
later dates, even if they are pessimistic about future payoffs, and 
produce a sizable liquidity discount. During periods when the 
alternative asset is illiquid, investors trade the liquid equity index 
instead, leading to strong spillover effects.</div>

Adjusting for the resulting selection bias cuts average annual index

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20780_abstract">We
 investigate the effect of cross-country differences in collateral laws 
for movable assets on lending and the sectoral allocation of resources. 
We employ a unique micro-level database for a particular global bank, 
which includes loan amounts and the bank’s estimated liquidation values 
of loan collateral in 12 emerging market countries. Weak 
collateralization laws that discourage the use of movables assets tilt 
lending toward the use of immovable assets. Further, loan-to-value of 
loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with 
weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets. To examine the 
effect of collateral laws on real activity we map the relationship of 
collateral laws to asset-composition and sectoral resource allocation 
using industry-level output data. Weak movable collateral laws create 
distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based 
production. In addition to our cross-country analysis, we perform a 
within-country analysis of Slovakia’s collateral law reform, which 
confirms our findings. The results shed light on an important channel – 
collateral laws – through which legal institutions affect lending and 
real economic activity.</div>

 incompleteness is one of the core principles in much of corporate 
finance theory, but the lack of quantitative measures of completeness 
has made direct empirical testing difficult. This paper fills this gap 
by proposing several measures of contractual detail using text based 
analysis. We analyze the default sections of a sample of private loan 
contracts, generating several measures of contract detail and of the use
 of common ``boilerplate'' language. Contracts are more complex when 
there is greater default risk, more uncertainty, and longer maturities. 
Larger syndicates and repeat lending relationships increase this impact,
 suggesting an important role for renegotiation costs.  We also find 
evidence that more complex loan contracts are associated with increases 
in operating performance and cash holdings, suggesting that contractual 
completeness is associated with greater investment efficiency.</div>

 develop, and solve analytically, a dynamic model of optimal bank 
liability structure that incorporates bank run, regulatory closure, 
endogenous default, and endogenous deposit-insurance premium. 
Value-maximizing banks choose the ratio of deposits to subordinated debt
 so that endogenous default coincides with bank closure. Banks' optimal 
response to regulatory changes often counteracts regulators' objective 
in reducing bank failures. For example, the optimal response to the 
introduction of FDIC is to increase leverage by choosing a higher 
deposit ratio and a lower subordinated-debt ratio. We also find that 
banks' optimal leverage can be substantial even in the absence of 
material tax benefits.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21194_abstract">Ever
 increasing competition and search for returns have prompted 
institutional investors to place their holdings in the equity lending 
market, making them the largest suppliers of stocks for shorting. This 
paper shows that changes in the supply of lendable shares have important
 implications for corporate financial policies. It does so via 
quasi-experimental methods that build on the evolving framework of 
institutional investing. Using data from the equity lending market, we 
show that companies save more cash and repurchase more stocks when 
institutional investors make more of their stocks available for shorting
 in the market. The economic magnitudes involved are significant and the
 policy effects we document are particularly stronger for firms whose 
stocks are ex-ante less liquid and firms that are credit constrained ---
 who need to build internal liquidity to absorb external shocks. The 
study sheds new light on how the changing nature of capital market 
institutions shapes the liquidity needs of firms.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20023_abstract">This
 paper studies debt maturity management through early refinancing, in 
which firms simultaneously retire their outstanding bonds before the 
scheduled due date and issue new bonds as replacements. 
Speculative-grade firms frequently refinance early to extend the 
maturity of their outstanding bonds. This pattern is strongest when 
credit supply conditions are more accommodating, resulting in a 
procyclical debt maturity structure for speculative-grade firms. In 
contrast, investment-grade firms do not manage their maturity similarly.
 This difference has real consequences. Early refinancing and maturity 
extension allow speculative-grade firms to invest more, while 
investment-grade firms show no response of investment to early 
refinancing. I exploit the timing of the protection period of callable 
bonds to show that the effect of early refinancing on maturity and 
investment is not driven by unobservable firm characteristics or 
interest-rate conditions. The evidence is consistent with precautionary 
maturity management, in which speculative-grade firms extend maturity to
 hedge against refinancing risk caused by credit supply fluctuations. 
Longer maturity reduces the possibility of being forced to refinance 
during credit market downturns, allowing firms more flexibility to 
invest.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20041_abstract">The
 “low risk anomaly” refers to the empirical pattern that apparently 
high-risk equities do not earn commensurately high returns. In this 
paper, we consider the possibility that the risk anomaly represents 
mispricing, not a misspecification of risk, and develop the implications
 for corporate capital structure. The risk anomaly generates a simple 
tradeoff model: Starting at zero leverage, the overall cost of capital 
initially falls as leverage increases equity risk. As debt becomes 
risky, however, the marginal benefit of increasing equity risk declines.
 The optimum is reached at lower leverage for firms with high asset 
risk. Consistent with a risk anomaly tradeoff, firms with low-risk 
assets choose higher leverage. In addition, leverage is inversely 
related to systematic risk, holding constant total risk; a large number 
of firms maintain small or zero leverage despite high marginal tax 
rates; and many others maintain high leverage despite little tax 
benefit.</div>

 use a simple quantitative asset pricing model to "reverse-engineer" the
 sequences of stochastic shocks to housing demand and lending standards 
that are needed to exactly replicate the boom-bust patterns in U.S. 
household real estate value and mortgage debt over the period 1995 to 
2012. Conditional on the observed paths for U.S. disposable income 
growth and the mortgage interest rate, we consider four different 
specifications of the model that vary according to the way that 
household expectations are formed (rational versus moving average 
forecast rules) and the maturity of the mortgage contract (one-period 
versus long-term). We find that the model with moving average forecast 
rules and long-term mortgage debt does best in plausibly matching the 
patterns observed in the data. Counterfactual simulations show that 
shifting lending standards (as measured by a loan-to-equity limit) were 
an important driver of the episode while movements in the mortgage 
interest rate were not. All models deliver rapid consumption growth 
during the boom, negative consumption growth during the Great Recession,
 and sluggish consumption growth during the recovery when households are
 deleveraging.</div>

 research examines the entry decision and the impact that entry has on 
retail establishments in Chile. Contrary to evidence in the US, where 
big box retailers co-locate much more than economic opportunities would 
indicate makes sense, we find evidence that Chilean retailer entry 
decisions are based primarily on local and national economic conditions.
 The existence of incumbent stores repel entry. This may be due to the 
weaker regulatory and zoning restrictions in Chile or other unobserved 
differences between the US and Chile. When a new store is opened, the 
impact on the retail environment (measured by sales) depends on the 
spatial distance between the entrant and other firms, the length of time
 since entry, and the characteristics of both the entrant and incumbent.
 Entry has little to no measurable impact on the sales of incumbent 
stores. However, the typical entrant tends to increase total sales 
(incumbents and future entrants) for stores 2 to 4 miles away from the 
point of entry. In contrast, entrants who attract customers from long 
distances (larger market areas) tend to have negative spillovers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13754_abstract">It
 is widely recognized that severe house price declines played a central 
role in post-boom mortgage defaults. However, it is not clear how much 
the housing price boom caused “loose lending” and how much “loose 
lending” caused the housing price “bubble.” While several studies have 
explored the lending-house price interaction, results are mixed, and 
frequently are driven by the prior assumptions of the studies. Thus, it 
remains unclear how much restrictions on mortgage lending could dampen 
housing bubbles. This study, recognizing that prices and lending are 
interdependent and dynamic, uses vector auto-regression (VAR) to examine
 the relative contribution of several factors thought to be contributors
 to the house price bubble. It examines the roles of interest rates, 
leverage, and the wide-spread use of such “exotic” lending practices as 
low/no doc loans, low FICO scores, interest only loans, very high LTV 
loans, negative amortization, and “sub-prime” loans in general. The 
study uses a unique extension of VAR analysis to examine the probable 
effect that a continuing restriction on “loose lending” might have had 
on the increase in housing prices in the years leading up to the housing
 “bust” after 2007. The study uses a panel of quarterly data (2.1 
million loans) from 21 Florida counties from 1997 through 2006. We find 
that variation in lending policy accounts for between 25 and 45 percent 
of forecast variance in total appreciation during the time. In all of 
our analysis, the own-influence of appreciation is an important 
component, suggesting a “momentum” factor, while interest rates, in 
general, have the weakest effect. We find that extending the 
conventional VAR impulse-response analysis to 20 quarters, recognizing 
structure (fundamental vs non-fundamental factors), and introducing a 
unique sustained impulse analysis are all valuable steps.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13834_abstract">Agglomerations
 of economic activity result in higher rents, however it does not 
exclude the possibility of agglomeration spillovers to risk-induced 
reasons for investors. We address this issue by testing whether 
agglomeration economies based on rents in the commercial real estate 
office market carry over to capitalization rates. Using unique 
transaction-based data on individual commercial real estate properties 
in the Netherlands over 1990-2011, we find that agglomeration economies 
result in lower capitalization rates. This implies a substantial lower 
capitalization rate by approximately 2 (0.02%) to 8 (0.08%) basis points
 associated with agglomeration economies. Furthermore, we find that this
 effect of agglomeration diminishes with further distance when adding 
mutual exclusive rings, which is in line with the law of economic 
geography.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13848_abstract">We
 investigate the general equilibrium effects of housing supply on asset 
risk premiums in a production economy with housing. We show that the 
presence of intratemporal substitution between non-housing and housing 
consumption has the effect of mitigating consumption risk, in contrast 
to the result based on an exchange-economy model where consumption 
composition shocks are independent of non-housing consumption shocks 
(Piazzesi et al. (2007)). Moreover, a lower housing supply elasticity 
makes housing price more volatile in response to productivity shocks. It
 thus increases the housing risk premium via elevated consumption risk 
but reduces the equity risk premium via enhanced intratemporal 
substitution effect. Empirically, we use the land value share of home 
value as proxy for the housing supply elasticity, and find it predicts 
(negatively) excess stock returns and (positively) excess housing 
returns, especially in the long-horizon (6-12 quarters) return 
forecasts.</div>

 model decisions to construct housing under uncertainty, from a panel of
 land parcels zoned single family residential in LA County. The period 
1988 to 2012 includes two price booms followed by the savings and loans 
and the recent mortgage crises, respectively. The probability of 
construction depends on structural density and on profits from 
post-construction housing prices that vary stochastically among 
investors, and on a start-up cost that we model as noisy. The model 
detects the exuberance during the price booms as an expectation of a 
high return from investing in land (animal spirits) and, at the same 
time, a growing sensitivity to noise than to prices. Measured by 
entropy, during the 2000-2007 boom, noise climbed to 38% of the 
reservation price for land, but receded before house prices peaked. 
Reservation prices exceeded land prices by 6.21% during the boom of 
2000-2007, trailing by 2.06% during the crash. We derive the elasticity 
of housing supply from the annual construction elasticity on each land 
parcel, remedying the aggregative approach in the extant literature.  </div>

 paper analyzes the provision of residential parking in a monocentric 
city, with the ultimate goal of appraising the desirability and effects 
of regulations such as a minimum-parking requirement (MPR) per dwelling.
 The analysis considers three different regimes for provision of parking
 space: surface parking, underground parking, and structural parking, 
with the latter two regimes involving capital investment either in the 
form of an underground parking garage or an above-ground parking 
structure. Parking area is viewed as a dwelling attribute that, along 
with floor space, provides utility. In addition, road congestion in the 
neighborhood (which affects the commuting costs of local residents) 
depends on the average amount of off-street parking per dwelling, an 
externality that is ignored by profit-maximizing developers, making the 
equilibrium inefficient. The analysis explores the equilibrium spatial 
behavior of the two dwelling attributes as well as residential and 
parking structural density, and analysis of land rent shows which 
parking regimes are present in different parts of the city. Efficiency 
requires an increase in parking area per dwelling at each location, 
which can be achieved in a crude fashion by an MPR, whose effects are 
analyzed.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13851_abstract">Higher
 ability workers benefit more from bigger cities while housing costs 
there are higher for everyone, and yet there is little sorting on 
ability. A possible explanation is that young individuals have an 
imperfect assessment of their ability, and, when they learn about it, 
early decisions have had a lasting impact and reduce their incentives to
 move. We formalize this idea through an overlapping generations model 
of urban sorting by workers with heterogeneous ability and 
self-confidence, with the latter defined as individuals’ assessment of 
their own ability. We then test the location patterns predicted by the 
model over the life cycle on panel data from the National Longitudinal 
Survey of Youth 1979. We find that the city-size choices of individuals 
at different stages vary with ability and self-confidence in a way that 
closely matches our theoretical predictions.</div>

 fiscal decentralization has been praised as an important driver of its 
economic growth. Interjurisdictional competition has arguably 
incentivized officials to promote economic development. However, the 
downside of decentralization is that it enables local authorities to 
slow or block implementation of centrally‐mandated governance reforms, 
especially when these may negatively affect local development goals. We 
show in this paper that cities with larger budget deficits are slower to
 implement new transparency requirements. Additional evidence points to a
 bifurcation in development strategies. In fiscally strong cities, 
increased foreign investment leads to greater disclosure of pollution, 
suggesting a race to the top for cities hoping to become world class. In
 fiscally weak cities, foreign investment is associated with decreased 
disclosure, suggesting they aim to be pollution havens. Similarly, 
fiscally strong cities increase pollution disclosures if they are highly
 polluted, suggesting a motivation to clean up, while fiscally weak 
cities decrease disclosures.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13889_abstract">This
 paper examines how reserve requirements influence the transmission of 
monetary policy through the bank lending channel in China while also 
taking into account the role of bank ownership. The transmission of 
monetary policy is a major question in China as banks play a key role in
 the Chinese financial system and provide most of the funding to firms. 
The implementation of Chinese monetary policy is characterized by the 
reliance on the reserve requirements as a regular policy tool with 
frequent adjustments. Using a large dataset of 170 Chinese banks for the
 period 2004-2013, we analyze the reaction of loan supply to changes in 
reserve requirements. To this end, we analyze the reaction of loan 
supply to monetary policy actions using the methodology of Kashyap and 
Stein (1995, 2000). We find no evidence of the bank lending channel 
through the use of reserve requirements. We observe nonetheless that 
changes in reserve requirements influence loan growth of banks. The same
 findings hold true for other monetary policy instruments. Further, we 
show that the bank ownership influences the transmission of monetary 
policy. As a consequence, the changes in the ownership structure of the 
banking industry through privatization or foreign bank entry can foster 
or hamper the effectiveness of the monetary policy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13890_abstract">Relying
 on quarterly data since 1998 we estimate, for China and the U.S., small
 scale econometric models that economize on the number of variables 
employed and yet are rich enough to provide useful insights about 
spillover effects between the two countries under different maintained 
assumptions about the exogeneity of the macroeconomic relationship 
between them. We conclude that inflation in China responds to credit 
shocks. Indeed, the monetary transmission mechanism in China resembles 
that of the US even if the channels through which monetary policy 
affects their respective economies differ. We also find that the 
monetary policy stance of the PBOC was helpful in mitigating the impact 
of the global financial crisis of 2008-9. Finally, spillovers from the 
US to China are significant and originate from both through the real and
 financial sectors of the US economy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13704_abstract">Institutions
 are patterns of social activity that design roles for persons as social
 actors, service and are serviced by other institutions, and operate as 
systems. The main activity inside institutions that is utilized to 
complete the service responsibilities--which includes production--is the
 formulation and enforcement of rules, regulations, and requirements. 
The concepts of closed systems, endogeneity, and self-organized systems 
have been offered as being relevant for the analysis of institutional 
systems. As explained here, those concepts are inconsistent with the 
processing of real-world institutions. When conducting analysis inside 
institutions, it is necessary to recognize, observe, and model the 
rules, regulations, requirements which are formulated to be consistent 
with the normative belief, technological, and ecological criteria of 
institutions. Generally, social scientists have emphasized belief 
criteria, and ignored technological and ecological criteria. 



This paper explains new complex system concepts for conducting analysis 
inside institutions. The first half of the paper is devoted to 
explaining new characteristics and theories found in three prior 
studies. The new knowledge is utilized to analyze and extend other 
studies completed whose analysis was made inside institutions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14261_abstract">In
 the past 3 decades, agriculture has expanded very rapidly and the main 
source of irrigation has been underground water in Iran. Mistaken 
policies regarding extraction of underground water and inefficient 
supervision on the loans that were allocated for renovation of 
irrigation system were the main reasons behind the water crisis in Iran.
 In the same time, the country faced the problem of accelerating 
unemployment and underemployment, especially in dry lands and drought 
stricken regions. With rising poverty and malnourishment, crimes and 
social problems grew very rapidly; and conserving water and land and 
creating job opportunities became the most important priorities. As 
farmers’ income is generally low and private firms do not run the risk 
to invest in agricultural activities, public work scheme is the only 
means to prevent agricultural problems to become a catastrophe. Public 
work projects such as providing water delivery systems, drainage, sewage
 and sanitation, with direct involvement of local communities, is the 
most effective way to prevent unemployment and poverty to become a 
social disaster. Public works schemes can mitigate the thread of 
expanding water crisis, and revitalize agricultural sector through 
government investment and direct involvement of local beneficiaries in 
implementation of watershed projects.</div>

 paper examines aspects of the job guarantee (JG) programs that promote 
sustainability, which is defined as the well-being of human society, 
economy and the environment. Literature has shown that the Job guarantee
 program, funded by the federal government is guided by a set of social 
objectives rather than profit motive. As a consequence of that, JG 
programs can end poverty due to joblessness, reduce inequality, perform 
must needed public and environmental services. Many JG scholars have 
stressed that the program should be structured and implemented at the 
local level by established NGOs. Furthermore, this paper adds that when 
combined with bioregionalism, jobs performed can foster healthy, 
cohesive, and low carbon community. Along with teaching of alternative 
philosophy, such as Buddhism, and anarcho-communism, bioregional JG 
programs may assist the creation of a new social ethos, one that not 
materialist nor self-maximizing, one that is grounded in cooperation, 
minimal! ism, democracy and conservation. With the creation of this new

 The Limits to Growth, Meadows et al. (1972) predicted an end to growth 
early in the early 21st century. The 30-Year Update of that work as well
 as numerous scientific studies suggest, that we still face precisely 
the same limits to growth outlined in the 1972 work. Humanity has, 
however, accelerated the growth of its ecological footprint on Earth, 
and limits to growth now threaten a collapse of human society. Our 
monopoly-capitalist economic system has effectively already been 
adjusting to the limits to growth by increasingly seeking profit through
 financialization rather than real production. Mainstream 
macroeconomists have tended to ignore the limits to growth altogether, 
and they continue to urge targeting full employment by means of policies
 to stimulate GDP growth. After the 2007-2009 financial collapse, 
mainstream economists called supported quantitative easing and 
neoliberal austerity policies to restore GDP growth to pre-crisis rates.
 Post Keynesians usually! only differed in that they called for fiscal 
stimulus rather than quantitative easing and neoliberal reforms to 
restore GDP growth. Even environmentally-conscious development 
economists continue to seek growth although they do urge that growth be 
sustainable. Only a few economists linked to the decroissance movement 
in France have openly argued for the deep structural changes in our 
economies to deal with a no-growth economy. This paper argues that Post 
Keynesians are, despite their recent tepid concern for the environment, 
actually well-positioned to deal with limits to growth because they are 
open to active macroeconomic policies that actually change the structure
 of our economy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13959_abstract">Noise,
 traffic and air pollution are among common externalities of industrial 
production and mining. While these externalities arise on site and are 
experienced locally, they can be exported through the transport of 
output from the production site, via trucking and rail. As a result, the
 broader region surrounding the industrial activity, together with more 
distant communities, are brought to bear the externalities of those land
 uses through increased load on the transport infrastructure.

The economics literature on locally undesirable land uses (LULUs) has 
largely focused on measuring external impacts surrounding the site, but 
externalities around the transport network are potentially more 
problematic. Whereas endogenous land prices discourage the siting of 
LULUs near economically valuable alternative land uses, this pricing 
mechanism is absent on open access transport networks. For this reason, 
in the absence of government regulation, one would expect industrial 
firms to internalize land use externalities in their location choice but
 not with respect to their use of existing transport networks. 

We examine these ideas in detail in the context of the recent 
“frac-sand” mining boom in Wisconsin. Due to the proliferation of 
hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota, Texas, Pennsylvania and elsewhere,
 demand for otherwise low-value silica sand in Wisconsin and neighboring
 states spiked during 2010-2013. This led to an increase from 10 to 
approximately 130 mines and processing facilities over a four-year 
period. The sand boom has triggered complaints of local externalities 
including noise, light, industrial traffic and air pollution on and near
 transportation networks. We study this episode theoretically and 
empirically by combining panel data on sand mine openings and 
production, traffic on nearby roads and rail tracks, vehicle accidents, 
local air pollution and property values. We find preliminary evidence of
 negative externalities of increased mining on road use, concentrated 
near sources and freight lines</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13961_abstract">The
 property-value hedonic model (3) has been used by environmental 
economists to value a myriad of local public goods. Recent literature 
(1,2) has described an important bias
induced by the assumption that households are not forward-looking in 
their purchase decisions. Important, however, is the fact that the 
estimation of dynamic models is not without substantial computational 
cost. Here, we seek to describe more fully the potential bias associated
 with the traditional approach and relate it to the time-series trend of
 the amenity of interest.
In the hedonic framework, the econometrician observes housing price and 
the consumed quantity of good x and is then able to infer x's implicit 
price and recover the willingness-to-pay of the household. However, if 
households are choosing where to live based on some average stream of 
future x, versus current x, the traditional model will be either under- 
or over-attributing the true quantity consumed. We refer to this as the 
"quantity effect". Less obvious is what we refer to as the "price 
effect": if the econometrician is recovering the implicit price of x 
under quantity mismeasurement, the implicit price of x will also be 
under- or over-stated. Both the size and direction of these effects 
(and, therefore, the size of the bias on willingness-to-pay) will be 
driven by the evolution of the amenity of interest. 

Specifying a forward-looking model of hedonic demand, we use these 
descriptive quantity- and price- effects to describe (in both equations 
and a series of intuitive graphs) potential
first-stage analyses of one's data to warrant the implementation of a 
forward-looking model. Additionally, we present an appealing result 
where the forward-looking model and the traditional model yield the 
exact same estimate of willingness-to-pay, even when the amenity is 
evolving (even rapidly) through time, as the quantity- and price- 
effects perfectly offset one another.</div>

 empirical evidence suggests that when consumers are faced with complex 
nonlinear pricing schedules, they make choices based on average (rather 
than marginal) prices.  Taking such behavior as given, we characterize a
 monopolist's optimal nonlinear price schedule.  In contrast to a 
setting with neoclassical ("marginal price") consumers,  optimal 
nonlinear prices in a setting with  "average-price bias"  exhibit 
quantity premia rather than quantity discounts.  In addition, 
consumption is distorted downward for  consumers with the highest 
marginal values.  Both of these properties arise from the fact that the 
monopolist may extract all of the information rents from an 
average-price bias consumer, but must now leave such consumers 
"curvature rents."  Whether or not a monopolist prefers neoclassical 
consumers to those with an average-price bias depends upon underlying 
preferences, type distributions and costs.</div>

 investigate how multinational firms contribute to the transmission of 
shocks across countries using a large firm-level dataset that contains 
ownership information for 8 million firms in 34 countries. We use these 
data to document two novel empirical patterns. First, foreign affiliate 
and headquarter sales exhibit strong positive comovement: a 10% growth 
in the sales of the headquarter is associated with a 2% growth in the 
sales of the affiliate. Second, shocks to the source country account for
 a significant fraction of the variation in sales growth at the 
source-destination level. We propose a parsimonious quantitative model 
to interpret these findings and to evaluate the role of multinational 
firms for international business cycle transmission. For the typical 
country, the impact of foreign shocks transmitted by all foreign 
multinationals combined is non-negligible, accounting for about 10% of 
aggregate productivity shocks. On the other hand, since bilateral 
multinational production shares are small, interdependence between most 
individual country pairs is minimal. Our results do reveal substantial 
heterogeneity in the strength of this mechanism, with the most 
integrated countries significantly more affected by foreign shocks.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21689_abstract">Using
 novel firm-level microdata and leveraging a natural experiment, this 
paper provides causal evidence for the role of trade and multinational 
firms in the cross-country transmission of shocks. Foreign multinational
 affiliates in the U.S. exhibit substantial intermediate input linkages 
with their source country. The scope for these linkages to generate 
cross-country spillovers in the domestic market depends on the 
elasticity of substitution with respect to other inputs. Using the 2011 
Tohoku earthquake as an exogenous shock, we estimate this elasticity for
 those firms most reliant on Japanese imported inputs: the U.S. 
affiliates of Japanese multinationals. These firms suffered large drops 
in U.S. output in the months following the shock, roughly one-for-one 
with the drop in imports and consistent with a Leontief relationship 
between imported and domestic inputs. Structural estimates of the 
production function for these firms yield disaggregated production 
elasticities that are similarly low. Our results suggest that global 
supply chains are sufficiently rigid to play an important role in the 
cross-country transmission of shocks.</div>

between trade and multinational activity that deliver gravity-style 
predictions for foreign affiliates’ sales. However, intra-firm trade is 
not common across foreign affiliates, but rather concentrated among a 
small set of large multinational firms (Ramondo et al., 2014). In 
addition, we document that not only firms in the upper-tail of the firm 
size distribution are subject to gravity forces, but also the sales of 
relatively small foreign affiliates are significantly affected by 
geographical barriers even when they rarely conduct intra-firm 
transactions. Two puzzles emerge: (i) why is intra-firm trade 
concentrated among the largest multinational firms? (ii) what are the 
mechanisms that drive affiliates’ sales in the lower tail of the 
distribution to obey gravity forces, even in the absence of intra-firm 
trade? In this paper we deliver a framework to explain these two 
phenomena.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21691_abstract">Many
 models of international trade feature an up-front cost that firms pay 
to enter foreign markets. Despite the important role these costs play in
 determining trade linkages between international markets, we understand
 little about their structure or magnitude. In particular, we do not 
know if there are country complementarities or a global portion in these
 entry costs. A global sunk export entry cost is one the firm must pay 
to access any foreign market and would lead to increasing returns in the
 number of destinations served. Country complementarities might be 
geographic, for example, entering Germany reduces the cost of entering 
France, or they might be linguistic, so that exporting to Mexico lowers 
barriers to entry into Spain. The structure of these barriers to entry 
is important because it determines the structure of hysteresis and how 
trade between countries responds to shocks. Characterizing the structure
 of sunk entry costs relies on careful identification of state 
dependence conditional on heterogeneity. I employ reduced form and 
structural approaches along with the confidential universe of U.S. 
manufacturers' exporting behavior to conclude that export entry costs 
are mainly country specific. The structural model allows me to estimate 
that the global entry cost U.S. firms face is $20 thousand while country
 specific entry costs are between $3.7 million and $4.2 million per 
market.</div>

 substantial "value-added" literature that seeks to measure the overall 
impact of teachers on student achievement does not distinguish between 
teacher effects that are invariant to prevailing incentives and those 
that are responsive to them.  In contrast, we develop a reduced-form 
approach that -- for the first time -- allows us to separate out 
incentive-varying teacher effort from incentive-invariant teacher 
ability, and further, to explore whether the effects of effort and 
ability persist differentially.  Our approach exploits exogenous 
variation in the incentive strength of a well-known federal 
accountability scheme, along with rich administrative data covering all 
public school students in North Carolina.  These in hand, we first 
separately identify teacher effort and ability to determine their 
relative magnitudes contemporaneously, finding that a one standard 
deviation increase in teacher ability is equivalent to 20 percent of a 
standard deviation increase in student test scores, while an analogous 
change in teacher effort accounts for between 3 and 5 percent of a 
standard deviation increase.  We then use prior incentive strength to 
reject the hypothesis that the persistence of teacher ability and effort
 is similar: persistence is differential and in the case of effort, 
varies by grade.  These estimates feed into a structural approach that 
allows us to explore the implications of counterfactual incentive 
reforms for value-added measurement.  From a policy perspective, our 
results indicate that incentives matter when measuring the effects of 
teachers.  Furthermore, our analysis has implications concerning the 
cost effectiveness of sharpening incentives compared with altering the 
distribution of teacher ability across classrooms and schools.</div>

 financial aid increase college attendance and completion? Selection 
bias and the high implicit tax rates imposed by overlapping aid programs
 make this question difficult to answer. This paper reports initial 
findings from a randomized evaluation of a large privately-funded 
scholarship program for applicants to Nebraska’s public colleges and 
universities. Our research design answers the challenges of aid 
evaluation with random assignment of aid offers and a strong first stage
 for aid received: randomly assigned aid offers increased aid received 
markedly. This in turn appears to have boosted enrollment and 
persistence, while also shifting many applicants from two- to four-year 
schools. Awards offered to nonwhite applicants, to those with relatively
 low academic achievement, and to applicants who targeted less-selective
 four-year programs (as measured by admissions rates) generated the 
largest gains in enrollment and persistence, while effects were much 
smaller for applicants predicted to have stronger post-secondary 
outcomes in the absence of treatment. Thus, awards enabled groups with 
historically-low college attendance to ‘level up,’ largely equalizing 
enrollment and persistence rates with traditionally college-bound peers,
 particularly at four-year programs. Awards offered to prospective 
community college students had little effect on college enrollment or

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21810_abstract">Earnings
 inequality in the United States has increased rapidly over the last 
three decades, but little is known about the role of firms in this 
trend. For example, how much of the rise in earnings inequality can be 
attributed to rising dispersion between firms in the average wages they 
pay, and how much is due to rising wage dispersion among workers within 
firms? Similarly, how did rising inequality affect the wage earnings of 
different types of workers working for the same employer---men vs. 
women, young vs. old, new hires vs. senior employees, and so on? To 
address questions like these, we begin by constructing a matched 
employer-employee data set for the United States using administrative 
records. Covering all U.S. firms between 1978 to 2012, we show that 
virtually all of the rise in earnings dispersion between workers is 
accounted for by increasing dispersion in average wages paid by the 
employers of these individuals. In contrast, pay differences within 
employers have remained virtually unchanged, a finding that is robust 
across industries, geographical regions, and firm size groups. 
Furthermore, the wage gap between the most highly paid employees within 
these firms (CEOs and high level executives) and the average employee 
has increased only by a small amount, refuting oft-made claims that such
 widening gaps account for a large fraction of rising inequality in the 
population.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21811_abstract">The
 structure of marriage and child-rearing in U.S. households has 
undergone two marked shifts in the last three decades: a steep decline 
in the prevalence of marriage among young adults, and a sharp rise in 
the fraction of children born to unmarried mothers or living in 
single-headed households, the latter of which is concentrated among 
non-college and minority households and thus particularly affects 
lower-SES children. A potential contributor to both phenomena is the 
declining labor market opportunities faced by non-college and minority 
males, which make these males less valuable as marital partners. We 
explore the impact of the labor market on the marriage market by 
exploiting large scale, plausibly exogenous trade-induced shocks to 
local manufacturing employment, stemming from rising import competition 
from China. We trace out how these shocks impact marriage, divorce, 
childbearing, and the prevalence of children growing up in poor and 
single-parent households. We find that trade shocks between 1990 and 
2010 have had quite modest impacts on household structure in aggregate. 
When we disaggregate these shocks into components affecting male versus 
female employment, however, we find impacts that are both economically 
and statistically significant. Import shocks concentrated on male 
employment reduce marriage rates and fertility, raise the fraction of 
births due to teen mothers, and, most significantly, increase the 
fraction of children living either in poverty or in single-headed 
households. On net, our findings do not suggest that rising import 
competition from China has been an important contributor to changing 
marital behavior in this time interval, since these shocks have not been
 particularly biased against males. But our analysis strongly supports 
the hypothesis that changes in labor demand that reduce male employment 
opportunities may be a quantitatively important contributor to the rise 
in the share of U.S. children living in poor and in single-headed 
households.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21828_abstract">Since
 the start of the Great Recession, there has been a substantial decline 
in the rate of labor force participation (LFPR). Part of this decline 
appears to be the result of secular factors like the aging of the labor 
force. Using the SIPP, we focus on the fall in the participation rate of
 individuals aged 25 to 54. A novel contribution of our approach is to 
examine how this decline varies across the distribution of household 
income. We find that almost all of the decline in the LFPR of 25- to 
54-year-olds can be attributed to declining participation by individuals
 in households in the upper half of the household income distribution.  
The result that the decline in prime-age LFPR is concentrated in 
higher-income households continues a trend that started as early as 
2001.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21829_abstract">We
 document two striking facts about U.S. firm dynamics and interpret 
their significance for aggregate employment dynamics. The first 
observation is the steady decline in the firm entry rate over the last 
thirty years, and the second is the gradual shift of employment from 
younger to older firms over the same period. Both observations hold 
across industries and geographies. We show that, despite these trends, 
firms’ life-cycle dynamics and business-cycle properties have remained 
virtually unchanged. Consequently, the reallocation of employment toward
 older firms results entirely from the cumulative effect of the 
thirty-year decline in firm entry. This “start-up deficit” has both an 
immediate and a delayed (by shifting the age distribution) effect on 
aggregate employment dynamics. Recognizing this evolving heterogeneity 
is crucial for understanding shifts in aggregate behavior of employment 
over the business cycle. With mature firms less responsive to business 
cycle shocks, the cyclical component of aggregate employment growth 
diminishes with the increasing share of mature firms. At the same time, 
the trend decline in firm entry masks the diminishing cyclicality during
 contractions and reinforces it during expansions, which generates the 
appearance of jobless recoveries where aggregate employment recovers 
slowly relative to output.</div>

 quarterly data for the U.K. from 1993 through 2012, we document that in
 economic downturns a smaller fraction of unemployed workers change 
their career when starting a new job. Moreover, the proportion of total

recessions. Together with a simultaneous drop in overall turnover, this 
implies that the number of career changes declines during recessions. 
These results indicate that recessions are times of subdued reallocation

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21781_abstract">Randomized
 experiments are increasingly popular in applied economics, since their 
structure provides a credible source of identification of causal 
effects. This paper is concerned with how we should analyze data from 
randomized experiments. While covariates are not necessary to achieve 
identification, accounting for them generally yields more efficient 
estimators of causal parameters like the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
 However, accounting for covariates is often not straightforward. If 
parametric specifications are used, an incorrect model could make the 
final estimator inconsistent for the ATE. If nonparametric methods are 
used, then the point estimate of the ATE is often very sensitive to the 
choice of tuning parameters. This paper proposes a simple estimator of 
the ATE that is robust to the way one controls for covariates. Our 
estimator is flexible, and can be combined with essentially any existing
 method for covariate adjustment. If a parametric specification is used,
 our construction yields an estimate that is consistent and 
asymptotically normal under arbitrary forms of misspecification, and 
fully efficient if the parametric model happens to be correct. If a 
nonparametric adjustment is used, our estimator is consistent, 
asymptotically normal, fully efficient and insensitive to the choice of 
smoothing parameters. This suggests that our method should be used 
routinely for the analysis of data generated by randomized experiments.</div>

 paper develops extremum estimation and inference results for nonlinear 
models with very general forms of potential identification failure when 
the source of this identification failure is known. We examine models 
that may have a deficient but nonzero rank Jacobian matrix in certain 
parts of the parameter space. We characterize weak identification in 
these models by examining sequences of parameters for which the 
parameter governing the potential identification failure drifts toward 
the point of identification failure as the sample size grows. This 
analysis leads to a “local to deficient-rank Jacobian” that does not 
necessarily have zero rank, allowing us to incorporate many models that 
have not been previously studied in the weak identification literature. 
In order to derive the local asymptotic theory for the estimators, the 
paper introduces a transformation of the parameter space as a key 
technical step. Asymptotic distributional results for extremum 
estimators are developed under a comprehensive class of identification 
strengths and uniformly valid inference procedures robust to 
identification strength are developed from these results. Importantly, 
the results allow one to conduct uniformly valid subvector inference. 
The paper focuses on four examples of models to illustrate the results: 
sample selection models, models of potential outcomes with endogenous 
treatment, threshold crossing models, and mixed proportional hazard 
models.</div>

 paper studies the averaging GMM estimator that combines a conservative 
GMM estimator based on valid moment conditions and an aggressive GMM 
estimator based on both valid and possibly misspecified moment 
conditions, where the weight is the sample analog of an infeasible 
optimal weight. It is an alternative to pre-test estimators that switch 
between the conservative and aggressive estimators based on model 
specification tests. This averaging estimator is robust in the sense 
that it uniformly dominates the conservative estimator by reducing the 
risk under any degree of misspecification, whereas the pre-test 
estimators reduce the risk in parts of the parameter space and increase 
it in other parts.

To establish uniform dominance of one estimator over another, we 
establish asymptotic theories on uniform approximations of the 
finite-sample risk differences between two estimators. These asymptotic 
results are developed along drifting sequences of data generating 
processes (DGPs) that model various degrees of local misspecification as
 well as global misspecification. Extending seminal results on the 
James-Stein estimator, the uniform dominance is established in 
non-Gaussian semiparametric nonlinear models. The proposed averaging 
estimator is applied to estimate the human capital production function 
in a life-cycle labor supply model.</div>

 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent anemic recovery 
have rekindled academic interest in quantifying the impact of 
uncertainty on macroeconomic dynamics based on the premise that 
uncertainty causes economic activity to slow down and contract. In this 
paper, we study the interrelation between financial markets volatility 
and economic activity assuming that both variables are driven by the 
same set of unobserved common factors. By relaying on the multi-country 
nature of our data, we can identify and estimate a statistically 
significant and economically sizable impact of current GDP growth on 
current volatility, and no effect of volatility shocks on business 
cycles, over and above those driven by the common factors.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21770_abstract">The
 global financial crisis led to a sharp contraction in US and Euro Area 
(EA) GDP, and was followed by a long-lasting slump. The post-crisis 
adjustment in the US and the EA shows striking differences. The EA slump
 is more persistent and characterized by a more pronounced contraction 
in TFP growth. During the slump, the wage share rose in the EA, while it
 fell in the US. This paper uses an estimated 3-region (US, EA and ROW) 
New Keynesian DSGE model with sovereign debt, banks and financial shocks
  to quantify the drivers of the divergent EA and US adjustment paths. 
Our results suggest that the European sovereign debt crisis following 
the 2009 recession, a less aggressive initial response of EA monetary 
and fiscal policy, a more vulnerable banking sector and greater 
rigidities in goods and labor markets explain the greater persistence of
 the EA slump. Moreover, the interaction between downward nominal 
rigidities and financial frictions is key for accounting for the 
persistent European slump. A negative TFP shock in combination with wage
 adjustment frictions generates an increase of the wage share as 
observed for the EA.</div>

 paper documents a new type of cross-border bank lending channel, using a
 novel dataset on the balance sheets of U.S. branches of foreign banks 
and their syndicated loans.  During the European sovereign debt crisis 
in mid-2011, some of the U.S. branches of European banks faced a dollar 
liquidity shock — due to their perceived risk reflecting the sovereign 
risk of their countries of origin — which in turn affected the branches’
 lending to U.S. entities.  Our results show that: (1) The U.S. branches
 of euro-area banks suffered a liquidity shock in the form of reduced 
access to large time deposits, mainly from U.S. money market funds, 
which prompted them to reduce lending to U.S. firms.  The reduction in 
lending took place mostly along the extensive margin and negatively 
affected U.S. corporate investment.  (2) The affected branches received 
additional funding from their parent banks, but not enough to offset the
 lost deposits.  (3) The liquidity shock was related to country rather 
than bank-specific characteristics, reflecting a broad sentiment against
 the liabilities of euro-area banks.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13977_abstract">Across
 the industrialized world, health and mortality gradients by education 
and income have generally been steepening. The leading explanations for 
the increased gaps in life expectancy involve differential trends in 
smoking, diet and exercise, stress, chronic disease management, and 
access to health care. Less well known, however, is the impact these 
trends will have on public programs and their progressivity—especially 
Social Security and Medicare. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To fill this gap, this paper uses the Future Elderly Model (FEM), a 
micro-simulation model of health and economic outcomes for older 
Americans, to estimate the effects of steeper mortality gradients on the
 progressivity of Social Security and Medicare benefits. This study 
produces projections to develop new insights about the long-run 
macroeconomic effects of the aging U.S. population, with a focus on 
distributional consequences.  This paper expands the FEM to incorporate 
user assumptions about the trends in inequality, and then examines how 
changes in inequality affect progressivity.  Findings suggest 
significant reductions in progressivity of both Medicare and Social 
Security if current mortality trends persist and noticeable effects on 
total program costs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13978_abstract">Life
 expectancy at age 65 has increased by 5 years over the past 
half-century, with the greatest gains going to high-income individuals. 
 This trend towards longer lives jeopardizes the long-term solvency of 
the Social Security system and has raised the specter of Social Security
 reform.  How might rising inequality in life expectancy and potential 
Social Security reforms affect lifetime Social Security benefits, and 
how does this vary with lifetime income?   We explore these questions, 
making use of the Future Elderly Model (FEM), a microsimulation model 
that tracks cohorts starting at age 50 and projects future health status
 and economic outcomes using data from the Health and Retirement Study, 
the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and the Medicare Current 
Beneficiary Survey.  In the model, retirement and benefit claiming 
decisions are dynamic and depend on health and economic conditions.  We 
find that rising inequality in life expectancy reduces the progressivity
 of the Social Security system.  We also find that there are potential 
reforms, including raising the Full Retirement Age, which would have a 
progressive effect on lifetime benefits.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13979_abstract">Over
 a decade ago, the aspirin cardiovascular data reached a tipping point 
and led to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
giving daily aspirin an “A” recommendation for the prevention of 
myocardial infarction in men and ischemic stroke in women. Despite this,
 aspirin use remains low relative to the populations targeted by the 
USPSTF. This article seeks to determine the long-term economic and 
population health impact of full compliance with the USPSTF guidelines. 
To that end, simulations are conducted using the Future Elderly Model 
(FEM), an established dynamic microsimulation that follows Americans 
aged 51 and older. Using the well-recognized estimates of the health 
impact of aspirin–including both its known benefits and main side 
effects–, we construct an FEM scenario in which daily aspirin use 
increases in accordance with the USPSTF guidelines. The difference in 
outcomes between this scenario and the baseline FEM reveals the impact 
of compliance with the guidelines. We account for the uncertainty in 
aspirin effectiveness by sampling estimates of the clinical effects from
 the confidence intervals for relative risks reported by the medical 
literature. The outcomes projected are chosen to provide a broad 
perspective of both the individual and societal impacts of compliance 
with the guidelines, and include: incidence of heart disease, stroke, 
and cancer, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
disability-free life expectancy, medical costs–decomposed into total 
medical spending, Medicare parts A, B and D, and Medicaid–, Social 
Security benefits, Disability benefits, and Supplemental Security 
Income.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14114_abstract">Organization
 of care between the four care diamond institutions in a developing and 
emerging economy is a matter of great concern for gender equality, for 
adequacy of care and for efficient functioning of the labour market.  
This is because (1) the main burden of care usually falls on households,
 resulting in women’s time stress and time poverty, (2) unpaid work, 
which is a lifelong time tax on women, restricts their opportunities in 
life, (3) unequal burden of unpaid care, along with the social norms, 
result in their inferior status in the labour market, and (4) frequently
 care deficiency affects the present and future well being of children. 
 

The usual approaches recommended include policies that help women and 
men in managing work-life balance and in integrating women in the labour
 market, policies that raise opportunities for women in the labour 
market through education and training in skills and entrepreneurship and
 the 3-R approach of recognizing, reducing and reorganizing unpaid care 
(shifting some to the mainstream economy).

Though these approaches have definite advantages, they are not adequate 
to ensure complete gender equality in the economy and to provide level 
playing field to women in the labour market with men. They also cannot 
optimize the use of labour force under an efficient labour market. This 
is because the present view of the macro-economy is fractured, as it 
leaves out a major part of the economy. The paper shows empirically how 
incorporating unpaid care into labour market analysis helps and how a 
wider view of macro-economy integrates unpaid care in promoting gender 
equality, good care and healthy and sustainable economy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14115_abstract">This
 study analyzes the impact of social inclusion of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people on economic development in 39 
countries, 29 of which are emerging economies and 10 of which have 
active LGBT social movements and have significance to global development
 institutions. Little empirical research has tested the theoretical 
prediction - based on several economic frameworks – that inclusion of 
LGBT people is linked to a stronger economy.  The analysis takes two 
approaches. First, the “micro-level” approach uses an extensive 
literature review to identify barriers to freedoms for LGBT people that 
can affect economic development. Second, the “macro-level” approach 
defines inclusion as the legal rights of LGBT people, measured through 
two newly-developed indices. We use multivariate regression to analyze 
the effect of LGBT rights on per capita GDP and the Human Development 
Index.

The micro-level analysis finds substantial evidence that LGBT people are
 limited in their freedoms in ways that also create economic harms, such
 as lost labor time, lost productivity, underinvestment in human 
capital, and the inefficient allocation of human resources through 
discrimination. These impacts, in turn, may act as a drag on overall 
economic output. The macro-level analysis uses a fixed effects approach 
from 1990-2011 and reveals a clear positive correlation between per 
capita GDP and legal rights for LGB and transgender people In the full 
regressions, the impact of an additional legal right on per capita GDP 
is approximately $320, or about 3% of the average GDP per capita in the 
sample.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14116_abstract">Previous
 studies have found increased specialization and an increased income gap
 between heterosexual spouses after childbirth. This pattern is often 
contributed to the fact that men have on average higher wages and thus 
are relatively more productive in the labor market.&lt;br /&gt;
However a complementary explanation is that gender in itself affects the
 behavior of couples. The aim of this paper is to investigate the 
importance of gender for the division of labor in couples after having 
children.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In this paper I compare the effect of entering parenthood on the within 
couples income gaps in lesbian and heterosexual couples. Swedish 
population wide register data is used to sample lesbian and heterosexual
 couples with similar pre-childbirth income gaps. A 
difference-in-differences strategy is used to estimate the effect of the
 gender composition in couples on the change in the spousal income gap 
after childbirth. In this way I can estimate the effect of the gender 
composition of the parents on the division of labor after 
childbirth.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Heterosexual couples show increased specialization, in terms of a vast 
increase in their labor income gap, after becoming parents. In general 
the income gap is smaller in lesbian couples after childbirth also when 
comparing lesbian and heterosexual couples with the same pre-parenthood 
income gap. In lesbian couples, the child's birth mother takes more time
 off work to stay on parental leave in the first two years of the 
child's life. After that the division of labor in lesbian couples 
depends mainly on which partner gave birth to the child and the spouses 
relative earnings before childbirth.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14373_abstract">The
 financial crisis of 2007-2009 revealed that the corporate complexity of
 most of the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) presented a 
formidable obstacle to any plausible orderly resolution of these 
institutions. This paper documents the extent of this complexity making 
use of an historical time series, developed by the authors, that shows 
the evolution of the number of majority-owned subsidiaries of G-SIBs 
over time. After a very significant increase in complexity before the 
crisis and until 2011, this trend may be reversing, possibly in response
 to regulatory and market pressures on banks since then. Nonetheless the
 reduction in complexity has been uneven across institutions and may not
 persist. The econometric analysis of this new set of panel data 
produces two key results with relevant policy implications: first, the 
relationship found in previous studies between the number of 
subsidiaries and bank size loses significance when time effects are 
introduced; second, large mergers and acquisitions are a key driver of 
complexity and their effect remains significant even when time effects 
are considered. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14374_abstract">Global
 banks are diverse in size, business models, and organizational 
structure, and are often part of financial conglomerates. We conjecture 
that the complexity of these conglomerates, including their business 
lines and locational choices, influences the management of the global 
banks. Conditional on size, organizational complexity, as defined by 
numbers of entities in the conglomerate, should lead to more 
specialization by the participating entities. In particular we posit and
 show that the more complex global conglomerates manage their banks to 
support the liquidity needs of the overall organization. Using micro 
data on global banks with branch operations in the United States and 
details about the conglomerates to which they belong, we show that those
 branches that belong to more complex conglomerates are larger, have 
relatively less lending within the US, relatively more reliance on 
wholesale funding, and more net lending to the financial conglomerate. 
In response to an exogenous positive funding shock in the US, the 
branches associated with more complex families exhibit statistically and
 economically weaker expansions of balance sheets, loans, and funding 
compared with branches in simpler organizations.</div>

of organizational structure in branches or subsidiaries, which are characterized by different
arrangements for internal insurance against affiliates’ default. Financial synergies may be generated
by reduced default costs, exploitation of government bailouts and financial economies of
scale. Private and social values are compared with endogenous costs of debt and leverage, and
with constrained leverage. The analysis has implications for current proposals to “ring-fence”

employer-sponsored training – the trappings of equitably shared prosperity. Besides the&lt;br /&gt;
advantages in compensation and training opportunities for workers in larger firms, it is&lt;br /&gt;
reasonable to conclude that by investing in training at a higher rate than their smaller&lt;br /&gt;
counterparts, larger firms have played a particularly prominent role in the formation of the&lt;br /&gt;
economy’s human capital stock. Evidence is mounting, however, that employers in the&lt;br /&gt;
U.S., especially larger employers, may be backing away from this critical function of human&lt;br /&gt;
capital investor, potentially leaving a gap in the infrastructure that produces the nation’s&lt;br /&gt;
human capital and compromising the potential productivity of the workforce. Arguably, this&lt;br /&gt;
declining commitment to job training, especially among large firms, is an important, yet&lt;br /&gt;
under-developed, dimension to our economy’s waning commitment to shared prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;
The proposed study will provide empirical evidence on the contours of the overall decline in&lt;br /&gt;
job training, with particular emphasis on the decline in training in large firms compared to&lt;br /&gt;
their smaller counterparts. I will use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),&lt;br /&gt;
a large nationally-representative data set, to provide broad estimates of the reduction in&lt;br /&gt;
training, and in particular, the change in the size-training effect over the first decade of the&lt;br /&gt;
2000s. The data set is large enough to allow omparisons of how the size-training effect&lt;br /&gt;

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14163_abstract">Despite the recent recovery from the high unemployment rates that followed the Great
Recession, anxiety over the future direction of the labor market and the implications
for low- and moderate-income workers has remained at heightened levels. While some
analysts blame the sluggish recovery on the business cycle and insufficient demand, others
have interpreted the anemic performance of the labor market as a sign that some type
of fundamental mismatch exists between employer demands and the skills of available
workers. Many commentators have declared that the nation faces a severe shortage of
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills. Sorting out the type and degree
of skill mismatch is a critical matter for public policy. In this research I use detailed skill
surveys to gather data on both skill demands and the prevalence of skill gaps in two fastgrowing
technical occupations in the information technology and healthcare industries:
computer helpdesk technicians and clinical laboratory technicians. Following prior research
I have conducted on the manufacturing sector (Weaver and Osterman 2014), I rigorously
evaluate claims of skill mismatch by going beyond opinion questions and anecdotal reports.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14164_abstract">This paper has several goals. First, I show that during the “Great Recession”, alternative
measures of unemployment (e.g., part time for economic reasons) rose to record levels,
and during the current recovery remain elevated, especially for vulnerable workers.
Second, I demonstrate that alternative measures of unemployment are more sensitive to
changes in local macroeconomic conditions than the “official” BLS unemployment rate.
That is, a one percentage point increase in an area’s GSP has a greater impact on the
unemployment rate when it includes respondents that are working part-time for economic
reasons, discouraged, and out of the labor force but want a job. Third, I use metropolitan
area “official” unemployment rates to report how different recession and recovery patterns
(e.g., weak and strong) impact the employment outcomes of vulnerable workers. The results
affirm that any premature slowing of U.S. aggregate demand will diminish the hopes of
millions of Americans who are ready, willing, and able to expand their attachment to the
workforce. Some of the key findings are as follows: • The educational attainment, gender,
race, ethnicity and age of Americans who are discouraged, want a job, and working part time
for economic reasons are similar to the “officially” unemployed. • Discouraged workers,
those who want a job, and those who are working part time for economic reasons are more
sensitive to changes in local economic cond s as measured by local real GSP. • This
labor market slack is even present in local la markets that experienced the “best” or
“strongest” recoveries. • The strength of a local labor market’s recovery is linked to the
severity of its “Great Recession. Areas that had the most severe recessions are experiencing
the weakest recoveries. Areas with the mildest recessions are experiencing the strongest
recoveries.</div>

 last eight years have been disastrous for many workers, and 
particularly so for those with low human capital or other forms of 
disadvantage.  Although the Great Recession officially ended in 2009, 
the labor market has been very slow to recover. One explanation 
attributes the ongoing poor labor market outcomes of young and 
non-college workers to the combination of deficient aggregate labor 
demand and greater sensitivity of marginal workers to cyclical 
conditions.  A second attributes the recent outcomes to structural 
changes in the labor market.  These have importantly different policy 
implications:  Cyclical explanations imply that the main challenge is to
 raise aggregate labor demand and that if this is done many of the 
patterns seen in the last several years will revert to their prior 
trends.  Structural explanations, by contrast, suggest the recent 
experience is the “new normal,” absent policy responses to encourage 
more (or different) labor supply. This paper reviews recent data for 
evidence on the two explanations, focusing on wage trends as an 
indicator of the relative importance of labor supply and demand. I find 
little evidence of wage pressure in any quantitatively important labor 
markets before 2015. The most recent data is more mixed, but still 
suggests substantial ongoing slack. </div>

 U.S. government subsidizes retirement saving through 401(k) plans with 
$61.4 billion in tax expenditures annually, but the question of whether 
these tax incentives are effective in increasing saving remains 
unanswered.  Using longitudinal U.S. Social Security Administration data
 on tax-deferred earnings linked to the Survey of Income and Program 
Participation, the project examines whether the “catch-up provision,” 
which allows workers age 50 and over to contribute more to their 401(k) 
plans, has been effective in increasing earnings deferrals.  The study 
finds that contributions increased by $818 more among age-50-plus 
individuals constrained by the 401(k) tax-deferral limits relative to 
similar workers just under age 50, suggesting that constrained 
individuals respond to tax incentives.  For this group, the elasticity 
of retirement savings to the tax incentive is relatively high: a 
1-percentage-point increase in the tax-deferred limit leads to a 0.2 
percentage-point increase in 401(k) contributions.  But barely 1 percent
 of lower-saving participants took advantage of catch-up contributions, 
suggesting that raising the 401(k) limit is not likely to be a 
broad-based solution to retirement saving shortfalls.</div>

1990's and has been rising since then. However, little is known about earnings volatility
for women. Importantly, given increases in the returns to education, the large increase in
educational attainment for women, and the large increase in female labor force participation,
there is reason to believe that trends in volatility for men and women could be quite different.
We use an underutilized dataset, the SIPP Synthetic Beta and associated Gold Standard
File, to trace trends in earnings volatility by educational attainment and gender over the last
thirty-five years. The SIPP SSB is better suited to this task then any other dataset previously
used to study earnings volatility in the U.S. because it links every individual in a SIPP panel
to their complete administrative earnings histories both prospectively and retrospectively,
resulting in both long panels and very large cross-sections. This allows us to disaggregate
earnings volatility by subgroup in a way that was previously impossible.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14130_abstract">Since 1979, the U.S. labor market has experienced a rise in wage inequality as wage gains
concentrated among higher-wage workers. Average wages have stagnated while wages at
the low-end of the distribution have fallen in real value. Within those years, however, lowwage
workers have experienced two distinct trends. During the 1980s, low-wage workers
experienced pronounced wage declines. By contrast, low-wage workers achieved significant
wage gains by the end of the 1990s. Such changes in the U.S. labor market may have
important consequences for the earnings trajectories of low-wage workers. Presumably, the
decline in pay rates for low-to-average-wage workers during the 1980s would make it more
difficult for low-wage workers to make meaningful advances in their earnings and increase
the prevalence and length of low-wage careers. The reversal of this trend up through the
late 1990s may have, conversely, supported a decline in the number and length of low-wage
careers. This paper will focus on the question of whether these well-documented shifts in the
U.S. wage distribution have impacted two key features?prevalence and duration?of low-wage
careers using the SSB and associated Gold Standard files. These data uniquely links personlevel
micro-data from a nationally representative SIPP household survey with administrative
annual earnings data from the IRS spanning from 1978 to 2006. This paper also examines
how these dimensions of low-wage careers vary by educational attainment, gender, and race.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14438_abstract">The
 object of this paper is to show that the recent financial and economic 
crisis in Italy has very different impacts on men and women, according 
to their role in society. The paper proposes an analysis of the current 
economic crisis with a gender perspective. In order to do so, the impact
 of the crisis must be investigated by looking at both the productive as
 well as the social reproductive systems.    The paper is composed of 
two parts, a theoretical and an empirical one. The theoretical part 
presents a framework integrating different dimensions useful for a 
gender analysis.  The empirical part uses this theoretical framework to 
analyze the gender impacts of the crisis in Italy.    A general 
conclusion drawn is that while men were hit harder by the crisis (due to
 the industrial and constructions sectors involved), women are more 
likely to be hit at a 'second moment' due to austerity fiscal policy. 
This crisis might slow down the long and difficult process towards more 
gender equality</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14439_abstract">Women’s
 empowerment and gender equality are posited as desired outcomes of 
postapartheid economic development by the South African state. However, 
the state’s framing of empowerment is grounded in productivist logic 
which gives primacy to economic growth, converting labor from human 
activity to an input into production and placing the employment relation
 at the core of ostensibly emancipatory politics. In South Africa 
productivist logic necessitated a postapartheid reconceptualization of 
wage work from “a condition of oppression, degradation, and 
precariousness into a prospect of inclusion and human dignity” 
(Barchiesi 2011: 2). In this discourse, empowerment and gender equality 
are thus thought to emerge only through (equal) access to wage work.    
 Consequently, the state implemented market-oriented policies aimed at 
reducing labor market “distortions” like barriers to entry/mobility, sex
 discrimination, and poorly functioning credit markets. The state seeks 
to construct a freely functioning, real-world labor market in the image 
of the abstract labor market of economic models. However, structural 
inequalities that exist outside of the labor market gain materiality 
within the labor market, as they are reflected in wages but are not be 
mitigated by the elimination of supposed market distortions. Rather than
 combating structural inequalities, productivism, with a narrow focus on
 markets, seals off policy space, effectively eliminating prospects for 
social policies that could help address structural inequalities 
generated and maintained outside of the labor market proper. This 
foreclosing of policy space constrains the imaginations of policymakers 
but not of workers themselves, who express support for 
non-market-oriented policies.</div>

 markets of European countries have experienced an apparent paradox in 
recent years: trade union membership and labor disputes have decreased#

institutional contexts and adopts isolated perspectives. We develop a 
broader framework# integrating the individual’s with an institutional 
perspective. We join Varieties of Capitalism# Welfare State Typologies

 scope of structural changes that European labor markets have been 
undergoing in recent decades. Against this background# we deploy social 
psychologist Albert Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory in order to 
analyze the interplay of an individual’s understanding of the 
institutional environment and her beliefs about personal capacities. Our
 main argument is that in order for labor protest to occur# individuals 
must believe that there are structural reasons for precarious working 
conditions. However# we claim# neoliberal reforms have increasingly been
 accompanied by discourses about and beliefs in individualism# implying 
that the individual is responsible if her working conditions are 
precarious. Moreover# for protest to occur# individuals must believe 
that they possess the necessary capacities to carry out protest. 
However# they may suffer from self-devaluation when working under 
precarious conditions. We use data from the European Social Survey (ESS)

institutional contexts in order to test our theoretical analysis. The 
results are supportive of our argument.</div>

 the context of the prevailing abundance of diversity (biological, 
ethnic), the profound social inequalities, and the trends and attitudes 
of hegemonic forces in Latin America, a coherent process of 
environmental governance is proving difficult and environmental 
injustice is aggravated. Regardless of where one turns in the region, 
there is an increase in the number and intensity of conflicts between 
groups committed to promoting economic development (i.e., growth), and 
those claiming to speak for the planet and/or the welfare of the large

from these processes and are bearing the brunt of the negative impacts 
of these activities. This paper gives voice to the actors actually 
involved in developing alternatives to the development proposals of the 
hegemonic forces driving the transformations in their societies. These 
alternatives emerge from groups whose organizations are shaped by 
different cosmologies, products of their multiple ethnic origins, and by
 the profound philosophic and epistemological debates of the past

 debate over the Cobb–Douglas production function has been raging ever

unpublished exchange in 1971 over the efficacy of the Cobb–Douglas by 
two future Nobel Laureates, Robert Solow and Herbert Simon. Solow

critic. The correspondence demonstrates that the logical and empirical 
problems with the Cobb–Douglas were well known by the most advanced

productivity theory.</div>

 the face of a sustained recession, there is substantial disagreement 
about what, if anything, macroeconomic policy can do to create a more 
stable and prosperous society. This begs the question of why the 
economics profession fails to put forth a cogent policy framework. What 
explains our diminished ambition with respect to the theory of economic 
policy? Has mainstream macroeconomics undermined the belief in the 
ability of economists to make meaningful policy interventions? If so, 
does this imply that modern macroeconomics is founded in a belief in 
policy nihilism? Before we begin to entertain the question of policy 
nihilism, we must first consider if new classical economics, in 
superseding Keynesian policy activism, actually advanced the theory of 
economic policy. With this goal, this paper will focus on the 
contribution of Robert E. Lucas, Jr.’s influential 1976 paper, 
“Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique.” Reviewing a sample of 
papers that engage the Lucas critique (LC) will allow us to better 
assess if new classical economics is founded in a methodological 
rigorous, empirically valid, and theoretically sound framework. The 
papers under review cast a dark shadow of doubt upon Lucas’s central 
argument. </div>

 Although sub-Saharan African countries have made impressive strides 
over the past decades towards improving health outcomes, they continue 
to lag behind other regions, in major part because of inadequate 
investments in the health sector. In particular, lack of access to safe 
sources of drinking water and modern sanitation is a key cause of ill 
health and high death rates, especially among women and children in 
rural areas and poor urban agglomerations. In this paper, we seek to 
explore two questions: 1) whether increased allocation of foreign aid to
 the water and sanitation sectors contributes to improved access to 
these services in sub-Saharan countries; 2) whether improved access to 
water and sanitation is associated with improvement in health outcomes 
in these countries. The paper is based on panel data from OECD/DAC that 
provides volumes of aid disbursements by sector, in conjunction with 
country-level data on access to water and sanitation and health 
outcomes. The analysis uses pooled cross-sectional and panel data 
estimation techniques controlling for country specific effects, 
potential outliers, and potential endogeneity of regressors. The results
 from this study may shed light on strategies to accelerate progress in 
reaching key development goals in the health sector in African countries
 and to improve aid effectiveness.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13862_abstract">Abstract:
  Formal and semi-formal financial institutions (FSFI) have increasingly
 become involved in the financing of micro and small enterprises (MESs).
 For solving poverty issues, credit delivery plays a major role because 
it contributes to the development of the MSEs and improves the living 
and working conditions of the poor. Notwithstanding, the previous three 
rounds of the Ghana Living Standards Surveys (i.e. GLSS 3, GLSS4, and 
GLSS5) have shown that over 75 percent of loans taken by households were
 mainly from the informal financial sector (e.g., borrowing from family 
members, money lenders, etc.). The existing empirical evidence 
specifically suggests that a loan from this sector hinders SMEs growth 
and improvement in the living and working conditions of the poor because
 it usually comes with a high lending rate(s). Fortunately, the GLSS 6 
shows much improvement in the delivery of loans from the formal and 
semi-formal financial institutions to households in Ghana. In contrast 
to the previous three rounds of the GLSSs where credits from the FSFI to
 households in the country were less than 10 percent, the GLSS 6 shows 
that about 46 percent of loans taken in 2012/13 survey year came from 
the these two institutions. The improvements in loans from FSFI to 
households could be attributed to the passing of new financial 
institutions bills such as the Borrowers and Lenders Act (ACT 773) and 
the Non-Bank Financial Institutions Act (Act 774) in 2008. To the extent
 that the impacts of expanding access to credit on household, especially
 the poor, need not to be positive, and could be negative, it is 
important to comprehensively examine the impact of improvement in the 
delivery of credits from these institutions. The main source of data for
 this study is the Ghana Statistical Service. This study employs four 
different household surveys conducted by the Ghana Statistical Service 
in 1991/92, 1998/99, 2005/06, and 2012/13 to comprehensively examine 
changes in the delivery of loans to households over the four different 
survey years. In addition, using the passing of these bills to implement
 difference-in-differences (DID) research design, I estimate the impact 
of loans from FSFI on not only income from household agricultural and 
self-employment activities but also assets and expenditure. The results 
of the DID estimates show that FSFI loan has positive on non-farm 
self-employment income but negative effect on income from household 
agricultural activities.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13863_abstract">Abstract:
 With the introduction of the New National Policy on Education in 1981, 
plans were underway to overhaul the prior Nigerian education system. 
According to Fabunmi (1986) the previous education system was deemed 
archaic and there was need for a modern dynamic and progressive 
educational system. These plans gave birth to the 6-3-3-4 system. A 
system that allowed for six years in primary school, three years in 
Junior Secondary School (JSS), three years for Senior Secondary School 
(SSS) while the last four years are for tertiary education. Previously 
the country had a 6-5-4 system, which represents six years in primary 
school, five in secondary and four in tertiary. However, as there were 
debates on the inadequacy of the 6-5-4 system to prepare Nigerians to 
face whatever challenges, including employment problems, they may come 
across in future, the system was replaced. The move to the 6-3-3-4 
system was not solely about increasing the time spent in secondary 
education but also a radical change in the subject structure of 
education in secondary school. Also at the tertiary level, a 
professional orientation was adopted with an aim to minimize 
unemployment and produce skilled labor in science and technology. The 
6-3-3-4 system was setup to be different from the previous system in its
 goals and objectives. For example it was supposed to focus on 
\functional education" meaning an education that as noted in Uwaifo and 
Uddin (2009), allows those who pass through it function economically, 
intellectually, morally, politically and socially. Also, its main 
objective was to produce graduates who were more likely to be 
self-reliant, leading to a smooth school to work transition upon 
graduation. Despite the laudable objectives of the program, from its 
inception there were group who were opposed to it. By 2000 onwards, 
those opposed to the program increased rapidly and debates on the 
effectiveness of the system were at the core of this increased 
opposition. The diverse views of the program can be divided into two 
main ideas. One major view was that the 6-3-3-4 system if implemented 
correctly would yield success but in the Nigerian case had not been 
implemented properly. Those who hold this view further argue that 
despite the poor implementation, the 6-3-3-4 system better prepares 
students for success in the labor market compared to the prior system.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21639_abstract">Food
 security has been the bane of African countries even though these 
countries are agrarian economies. On average, about 50% of the labor 
force in African countries are engaged in agriculture which accounts for
 about 30% of GDP generally in Africa. This suggests that productivity 
in agriculture is very low in African countries. Low productivity in the
 largest sector of African economies has not only left many Africans 
poor, it has left African countries food insecure. The issue of food 
insecurity in African countries was brought to the fore during the 2008 
world food crisis when grain prices in African countries almost doubled.
In spite of the fact that African countries are agrarian economies, the 
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) data indicate 
that Africa is the only region in the developing world where food 
production per capita decreased during the last two decades. Despite 
efforts to increase agricultural output, productivity continues to be 
low with the consequence that food security is not assured. As a result,
 African countries have come to rely on food aid to meet food short 
falls.
In addition to food aid, Sub-Saharan African countries have been, and 
continue to be, the recipients of large amounts of agricultural 
aid—including inputs, technology, infrastructural support, policy advice
 and capacity building to increase agricultural productivity and improve
 food security. For example the U.S. government has promised about half a
 billion US$ to the Nigerian government in support of its agricultural 
transformation agenda (ATA), and the G-8’s New Alliance for Nutrition 
(located  at  the  World  Economic Forum) has promised large infusion of
 aid and private sector investment to improve agricultural productivity 
in African countries. In spite of this large aid flows to the 
agricultural sector, very few studies have been conducted to test the 
effectiveness of this aid flows—studies that will inform aid policy of 
both donors and recipients.
This paper uses panel data from a large number of African countries to 
investigate the impact of agricultural aid on food security in recipient
 countries. Specifically, we investigate the effects of agricultural aid
 on agricultural productivity in African countries over the 1980–2012 
period. Particularly, we investigate whether agricultural aid has 
significant positive impact on agricultural productivity and if so, 
which components of agricultural aid are effective in improving 
agricultural productivity. Controlling for several variables, we find 
that agricultural aid, especially the provision of improved seeds and 
capacity development improves agricultural productivity in African 
countries. On the other hand, the provision of mechanical aid does not 
significantly improve agricultural productivity in African countries, 
contrary to expectations. We also find regional differences in the 
effect of agricultural aid on agricultural productivity in Africa: the 
effects are highest in Southern Africa and lowest in West Africa.</div>

 examine whether federally sponsored voluntary environmental programs 
have reduced phosphorus pollution from agriculture over the past 30 
years. To test the effects of federal programs on water quality, we 
employ a unique dataset derived from daily observations on nutrient 
emissions taken over 37 years in several tributaries to Lake Erie. These
 data are linked to important ecological, hydrological, and economic 
factors that influence nutrient concentrations in agricultural 
watersheds. To identify the influence of federal programs on nutrient 
concentrations, we separate nutrient outputs into attached and soluble 
phosphorus, and we test for structural changes in key estimated 
parameters over time. For example, federal programs have long focused on
 trapping attached phosphorus in farm fields with conservation tillage 
and conservation set-asides. We show that these programs and their 
effects have strengthened over time. As expected, federal programs have 
had their 4 strongest impact on attached phosphorus during winter. In 
contrast, our model estimates an increasing trend in soluble phosphorus 
concentrations over time, which is surprising, given that the empirical 
evidence suggests that phosphorus inputs into our watersheds have 
decreased since the 1970s. We show that the seasonal pattern of 
concentrations has changed, with lower concentrations in summer and no 
change in winter. Given that most of the flow occurs in winter and 
spring, this suggests that federal programs have not reduced soluble 
phosphorus emissions, and consequently total phosphorus emissions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14348_abstract">Reductions
 in nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural cropland are needed to 
reduce the size of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. Recent estimates put
 the annual costs of achieving the average 5,000 km2 size at $2.7 
billion per year. In this work, we incorporate an additional objective 
of solution robustness, i.e., the mix and spatial location of 
agricultural conservation measures is cost-efficient (lies on the 
Pareto-front) under weather uncertainty. We employ a multi-objective 
evolutionary optimization algorithm which draws from historic weather 
conditions to formulate the hypoxia reduction objective, allowing us to 
select solutions which are more robust to the changing “fitness 
landscape” induced by weather variability. The solution from robust 
optimization that achieves, in expectation, the hypoxia policy goal, is 
estimated to cost about $2.5 billion per year (7.4% cost reduction from 
the previous estimate associated with using land retirement as one of 
conservation investment options). Given historic weather variability, 
the goal is achieved in 47% of the 5-year time windows. Ex-post 
variability analysis suggests that an investment of approximately $4.7 
billion per year would lead to at least a 75% chance (based on 
Chebyshev’s Inequality) of attaining the hypoxia policy goal.</div>

 a world free of transaction costs, conservation procurement auctions 
can cost-­‐ effectively allocate payment for environmental service 
contracts by targeting projects that provide the most benefit per dollar
 spent. However, auctions only succeed if many farmers choose to bid so 
that the auctioneer can evaluate many projects for targeted funding. As a
 part of ongoing efforts to address harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, 
real auctions for phosphorus reduction practices were implemented with 
farmers in two different NW Ohio counties. Bids were evaluated based on 
their expected environmental benefits – specifically their estimated 
reductions in phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie based on hydrological 
models applied to their farm. Bidding was thin. A follow-up survey 
revealed that complexity of the bidding process and the need to 
negotiate with renters deterred participation. Due to low participation,
 the actual conservation auction made payments for phosphorus reduction 
that were surprisingly costly at the margin. Applying a farmer 
behavioral model to the Western Lake Erie Basin, we simulate 
participation choice and cost-effectiveness of environmental outcomes in
 three conservation programs. Results reveal that when perceived 
transaction costs of bid preparation are high, auction programs that 
rank bidders are less cost-effective than spatially targeted, fixed 
conservation payments that attract higher participation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14350_abstract">Despite
 the success of efforts to reduce phosphorus (P) pollution from point 
sources, P from non-point agricultural sources remains a vexing problem 
that recent EPA assessments suggest impair half the nation’s lakes and 
rivers. We synthesize the state of knowledge and identify critical 
research priorities in four key areas related to reducing P pollution: 
costs, ecology, benefits, and policies. Key to the P pollution puzzle is
 to understand why it happens? We assess evidence from the economics 
literature, including issues of risk, input elasticities, and market 
failures, and contrast this with the common environmental science 
assertion that farmers “over-apply” P. Next, we assess the state of 
knowledge on ecological production functions linking P from farms to 
largely adverse, but sometimes positive, effects on downstream ecosystem
 services, including a critical look at EPA’s focus on metrics of 
ecological and biological condition rather than on connections to 
ecosystem services. This understanding then points to shortcomings in 
the valuation literature that limit the utility of most valuations 
studies, including inadequate linkages to policy relevant environmental 
quality metrics affected by P pollution. Putting these threads together,
 we address the effectiveness of alternative policies for reducing P 
pollution, including some successes and many failures with approaches 
such as trading, taxes, payments for environmental services, other 
conservation policies, and the potential for “green” labeling or supply 
chain pressures. We conclude by assessing critically needed innovations 
in the four areas.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13980_abstract">This
 study investigates whether and how Asian central banks responded to 
exchange rate movements, employing relatively recent data. Using 
Bayesian methods, we estimate a small open economy dynamic stochastic 
general equilibrium model for four emerging market inflation-targeting 
countries in Asia, namely Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and 
Thailand. Comparing with the results during the pre-crisis period when 
the emerging market countries tried to cope with currency appreciation, 
we find that almost all of the central banks of these countries targeted
 exchange rate movements during the crisis less than before. In 
addition, we find that in spite of the crisis, most monetary authorities
 did not fully intervene in the foreign exchange market. The findings 
suggest that emerging market countries did not offset currency 
depreciation as much as appreciation. This implies that asymmetry 
existed in the exchange rate management of these countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13981_abstract">This
 paper investigates the effect of liquidity shocks in China on the U.S. 
dollar exchange rate since 1996. The relative value of the U.S. dollar 
is important since it influences the debt burden of developing countries
 and impacts the tightness of global monetary policy. Under floating 
exchange rates, a monetary expansion results in depreciation of the 
domestic currency. However, the value of the Renminbi has either been 
tied to the U.S. dollar or been managed with reference to a basket of 
major currencies. Empirical results suggest that China’s liquidity 
expansion is associated with statistically significant decreases in the 
trade weighted values of the U.S. dollar and of the Japanese yen. A 
positive innovation in China’s M2 is associated with positive and 
statistically significant effects on oil and commodity prices. Shocks to
 China’s M2 have stronger impact on economic variables since about 2005,
 consistent with the growth of China’s economy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13982_abstract">This
 paper investigates a perception in the political debates as to what 
extent poor countries are affected by price movements in the global 
commodity markets. To test this perception, we use the case of India to 
establish in a standard SVAR model that global food prices influence 
aggregate prices and food prices in India. To further analyse these 
empirical results, we specify a small open economy New-Keynesian model 
including oil and food prices and estimate it using observed data over 
the period 1996Q2 to 2013Q2 by applying Bayesian estimation techniques. 
The results suggest that big part of the variation in inflation in India
 is due to cost-push shocks and, mainly during the years 2008 and 2010, 
also to global food price shocks, after having controlled for exogenous 
rainfall shocks. We conclude that the inflationary supply shocks 
(cost-push, oil price, domestic food price and global food price shocks)
 are important contributors to inflation in India. Since the monetary 
authority responds to these supply shocks with a higher interest rate 
which tends to slow growth, this raises concerns about how such output 
losses can be prevented by reducing exposure to commodity price shocks 
and thereby achieve higher growth.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13983_abstract">This
 paper analyzes a desirable transition path for East Asian countries 
given the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) transition to a new 
exchange rate regime. It attempts to answer two main questions: (i) 
Would these countries be better off shifting to either a basket peg or a
 floating regime following the PRC’s transition to a basket peg regime? 
(ii) How and when should these countries shift to the desired regime? 
The paper captures the influence of the PRC’s predetermined shift in its
 exchange rate regime on East Asian countries’ decisions regarding their
 optimal transition policies based on a dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy. Our calibration 
exercise using Malaysian and Singapore data from the first quarter (Q1) 
of 2000 to Q4 2012 reveals that a gradual adjustment to a basket peg is 
the most desirable policy for both countries. A sudden shift to a basket
 peg is superior to maintaining a dollar peg in Malaysia, but not in 
Singapore. Finally, a sudden shift to a floating regime is even worse 
than maintaining a dollar peg in both countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14572_abstract">Current
 estimates of tipping points in the literature suggest that racial 
progress in the US has been slow. According to these estimates, the mean
 tipping point of US cities increased from 12% in 1970 to 14% in 1990, 
an average of 1 percentage point per decade (Card et. al 2008). In this 
paper, I develop a new method for estimating tipping points which 
exploits the with-in city sorting of households to estimate tipping 
points at a finer level of geography – the census tract. These new 
results paint a more optimistic picture of racial progress in the US. 
According to these estimates, from 1970 to 2010, the mean tract-level 
tipping point in the US has increased from 15% to 42%. To compare these 
results to the literature, I aggregate my tract tipping points to the 
city level and find that the mean MSA tipping points also increase from 
13% to 35%, an average growth rate of 5 percentage points per decade. I 
show that prior estimates understated city tipping points because they 
reflected the average tipping points of marginal census tracts in the 
city, i.e. those that were close to tipping, whereas my estimates are an
 average of the tipping points of both the marginal and inframarginal 
census tracts in a city.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14573_abstract">Prescription drug abuse is America’s fastest-growing drug problem, with
overdose deaths from opioid pain relievers increasing by 313% from 1999 to
2010. This paper estimates the effect of supply-side interventions on prescription
drug availability, abuse, public health, and crime. The study is based in
Florida, the epicenter of the prescription drug abuse epidemic in the late-2000s,
where physicians prescribing and dispensing oxycodone from pain clinics were
the main source of drug diversion. In mid-2010, government officials initiated
a sweeping crackdown on Florida’s pain clinic suppliers, reducing the number
of pain clinic licenses by 59%. Using novel online and administrative data and
exploiting the timing and geographic location of the crackdown, I find that enforced
regulation of pharmaceuticals’ legal supply chain can reduce prescription
drug abuse substantially and sustainably. Between 2008-12, oxycodone street
prices increased by 238% and average supply decreased by 59%. In turn, indicators
of oxycodone consumption decreased significantly. There is no evidence
of an oxycodone price, supply, or consumption recovery. There is substitution
to heroin, but this offsetting effect is small relative to substantial public health
gains from decreases in oxycodone deaths and hospitalizations. In addition,
there is weak evidence of a decrease in drug arrests and index crimes.</div>

 paper examines the importance of trade-induced managerial incentives as
 a source of productivity gains. I introduce a principal-agent problem 
in a trade model with monopolistic competition and ﬁrm level 
heterogeneity, in which ﬁrms provide incentives to their managers to 
reduce costs. The model shows that trade liberalization, given by a 
reduction in trade costs, induces stronger managerial incentives among 
ﬁrms productive enough to export and weaker incentives for ﬁrms not 
productive enough to export. Among the exporters, the increase in 
incentives is higher for low-productive exporters than high-productive 
exporters. Examination of U.S. manufacturing ﬁrms yields evidence 
consistent with the model. I ﬁnd that between 5% and 8% of the industry 
productivity growth during the 1993-1998 period can be attributed to 
productivity gains through managerial incentives.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14575_abstract">In
 February 2012, New York City released value added scores for its grade 4
 through 8 public school teachers. There was little concern about the 
potential impact of the release of this public information on the 
housing values, residential segregation or school segregation for New 
York City dwellers. Since people “vote with their feet” (Tiebout, 1956),
 it is logical to believe that public information on teacher quality 
measures influences housing price, and resident and student mobility.

Hedonic, fixed effects models were used to analyze the teacher quality, 
school report card, residential housing sales, and American Community 
Survey data.  The housing market responds significantly to the new 
information provided by the release of the teacher quality information. 
The results also suggest that the highly debated release of teacher 
quality information has large implications on housing choices and an 
impact on school demographics. 

The results provide the first evidence of the effects of teacher quality
 scores on New York City’s housing market.  An increase in teacher 
quality increases housing prices and this influences the demographics of
 neighborhoods and schools.  The release of the data had some impact on 
increasing the average household income and educational levels in less 
affluent and less educated neighborhoods.  The results also indicate 
that homebuyers are responding to the data release are predominately 
White and are displacing Hispanic and Black residents.</div>

 religiosity is positively correlated with self-reported prosociality, 
observational and experimental studies on the long-hypothesized 
connection between religion and prosocial behavior have yielded mixed 
results.  Recent work highlights the role of religious salience for 
stimulating prosocial behavior, but much of this research has relied on 
priming Christian subjects in laboratory settings, limiting 
generalization to the real world.  Here I present a field study 
conducted in the Medina of Marrakesh, Morocco, which shows that 
religious salience can increase prosocial behavior with Muslim subjects 
in a natural setting.  In an economic decision making task similar to a 
dictator game, shopkeepers demonstrated increased prosocial behavior 
when the Islamic call to prayer was audible compared to when it was not 
audible.  This finding complements a growing literature on the 
connection between cultural cues, religious practices, and prosocial 
behavior, and supports the hypothesis that religious rituals play a role
 in galvanizing prosocial behavior.</div>

 this paper discusses a public good provision experiment with a 
stranger-treatment design that examined the differences in prosocial 
behavior between ethnicities (ethnic Zang, Bouyei and Han of China). The
 experimental results indicated that the prevalent view, which claims 
that contributions to public accounts decline with repetition and 
converge to lower levels, was consistent with our results from the 
ethnic Bouyei and Han. However, this view is in sharp contrast to the 
result obtained from the ethnic Zang, which exhibited a roughly 
increasing trend over the period. Moreover, we determined that the 
differences in contributions between ethnicities strongly depends on the
 degree of ethnic dominance (or ethnic diversity) by manipulating the 
ethnic composition of the experimental group. We further analyzed the 
forms of prosocial behavior by regression and determined that the ethnic
 Zang harbored the strongest reciprocity preference. Second, we 
identified a particular set of measurable factors as proxies for 
cultural influences on behavioral differences observed in experiments 
between ethnicities and demonstrated their significant explanatory 
power. The results indicated that all of the cultural factors accounted 
for the behavioral differences between the ethnic Han and the other two 
minor ethnicities; it was interesting to note that the behavioral 
difference between minor ethnicities was attributed to group structure 
only.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13406_abstract">A
 major source of the expansion of governments over the last several 
decades has been their role in operating social insurance programs.  
Most of these programs are implemented at the national level and in the 
recent past have been only rarely subject to large reforms, creating a 
major challenge for learning about the quantitative size of their 
consumption-smoothing benefits and moral hazard costs.  In this paper, 
we investigate the Old Age Assistance Program (OAA), a means-tested and 
state-administered pension program created by the Social Security Act of
 1935.  OAA was the primary source of government old age support through
 the 1930s and 1940s, remaining much larger than Social Security until 
the 1950s. Using newly available complete-count Census data from 1940, 
we exploit the large differences in OAA programs across states and the 
detailed rules that governed eligibility for OAA within states to 
estimate the labor supply effects of OAA. We find that OAA significantly
 reduced labor supply, with our main estimates indicating that OAA led 
to a 5.7 percentage point reduction in labor force participation among 
men aged 65--74, or 11 percent relative to the base of roughly 50 
percent participation.</div>

 Sweden. We find that winning a lottery prize modestly reduces labor 
earnings, with roughly 10 percent of the prize spent reducing earnings 
over the first 10 years. Earnings reductions are fairly similar by age 
and gender, but increase with pre-win earnings levels. We show that a 
calibrated dynamic labor supply model can account for our results both 
over the life cycle and across the earnings distribution, and we use the
 model to estimate key labor supply elasticities. Lastly, we find much 
larger earnings responses for winners than for their spouses, regardless
 of the gender of the winner; this is inconsistent with unitary 
household labor supply models which pool exogenous unearned income.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13409_abstract">We
 estimate the effect of Social Security benefits on earnings by 
examining the Social Security “Notch,” which cut Old Age and Survivors 
Insurance (OASI) benefits by around $800 per year for men in the 1917 
birth cohort relative to the 1916 cohort. This led to sharply different 
benefits for similar men born one day apart. Using Social Security 
Administration microdata on earnings in the full U.S. population by day 
of birth, we document a very large, visually clear, and statistically 
significant increase in elderly male earnings when moving from the end 
of the 1916 cohort to the beginning of the 1917 cohort. This contrasts 
with previous literature, based on yearly variation in birth timing, 
which found no evidence that the Notch had an impact on labor outcomes. 
The evidence suggests that the effect of OASI benefits on earnings is 
driven primarily by an income effect, and we find no evidence of a 
substitution effect. The estimates show that for a given decrease in 
discounted lifetime OASI benefits, mean discounted earnings in the 
elderly years rise by around half this amount. Our results suggest that 
the near-tripling in mean OASI benefits from 1950 to 1985 can account 
for a substantial fraction of the dramatic decline in the elderly male 
employment rate over this period.</div>

 paper introduces the Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI), a new panel 
survey of
wealthholders designed to yield high-quality measurements of a large 
sample of older Americans who arrive at retirement with significant 
financial assets. The VRI links survey data with a variety of 
administrative data from Vanguard. The survey features an 
account-by-account approach to asset measurement and a real-time 
feedback and correction mechanism that are shown to be highly successful
 in eliciting accurate measures of wealth. Specifically, the VRI data 
reflect unbiased and precise estimates of wealth when compared to 
administrative account data.  The VRI sample has characteristics similar
 to populations meeting analogous wealth and Internet access eligibility
 conditions in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Survey of 
Consumer Finances (SCF). To illustrate the value of the VRI, the paper 
shows that the relationship between wealth and expected retirement date 
is very different in the VRI than in the HRS and SCF— mainly because 
those surveys have so few observations where wealth levels are high 
enough to finance substantial consumption during retirement.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14344_abstract">Recent
 evidence suggests that labor earnings reported in household surveys 
compare favorably with labor earnings in administrative records.  On the
 other hand, imputed labor earnings in household surveys seem to match 
labor earnings in administrative records less closely.  This finding has
 led many researchers to question the reliability of imputed labor 
earnings and to exclude these observations from wage analyses.  However,
 this strategy might result in sample selection bias if labor earnings 
are not missing at random.  In this paper, we compare reported and 
imputed labor earnings from the 2008 and 2014 panels of the Survey of 
Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to labor earnings from the 
Social Security Administration’s Detailed Earnings Record.  We examine 
how the relationship between survey data and administrative records 
varies across demographic groups.  Finally, we characterize survey 
non-respondents in order to improve our understanding of whether and how
 individuals select out of response on observable dimensions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14345_abstract">Measures
 of U.S. earnings (and income) inequality rely heavily on the Current 
Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). A 
substantial and increasing share of individuals and households surveyed 
in the CPS either do not participate in the ASEC supplement, or 
participate but refuse to report earnings and other income. Imputation 
procedures assume that nonresponse is missing at random, conditional on 
measured covariates (MAR). Yet little is known how deviations from MAR 
affect inequality measures. We explore how nonresponse bias affects 
measures of the level and trends in earnings inequality. To do so, we 
use ASEC data for calendar years 1997-2010 matched to Social Security 
Detailed Earnings administrative tax records (DER). We find evidence 
that nonresponse is U-shaped, being flat over most of the distribution, 
but with high nonresponse in the left and far right tails of the 
distribution. Nonresponse bias causes inequality to be understated, with
 ASEC earnings responses including too few low earners and too few very 
high earners. Imputations for nonrespondents do not fully correct the 
bias. Measures of earnings inequality (Gini and earnings shares) confirm
 that ASEC inequality measures are lower than are measures for the same 
individuals based on administrative earnings, and this gap worsened in 
recent years.  Earnings shares among the top 1% of earners are lower by 
at least 20 percent in the ASEC compared to matched administrative tax 
records, with about half accounted for nonresponse and half to top 
coding in the ASEC.  Hybrid measures using ASEC earnings for CPS 
respondents and administrative DER earnings for nonrespondents produce 
intermediate estimates.</div>

 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS 
ASEC) serves as the data source for official income, poverty, and 
inequality statistics in the United States.  The Census Bureau has used a
 “hot deck” procedure to impute missing income values since 1962.  This 
paper implements an alternative imputation methodology, sequential 
regression multiple imputation (SRMI), to impute missing income values 
in the CPS ASEC. SRMI is a model-based approach to imputation.  It 
offers several potential advantages over the hot deck, including 1) 
greater flexibility to add additional covariates and 2) using multiple 
imputation to account for uncertainty in the imputation process.  We 
implement a baseline SRMI with data from the CPS ASEC and then augment 
this with tax records on earnings from the Social Security Detailed 
Earnings Records (DER) file.  We compare imputed income values from SRMI
 to those from the hot deck procedure along several dimensions including
 the mean, median, variance, and common official statistics derived from
 income (poverty and inequality).</div>

 began as a financial crisis in the United States in 2007-2008 quickly 
evolved into a massive crisis of the global real economy. We investigate
 the importance of the bank lending and firm borrowing channel in the 
international transmission of bank distress to the real economy—in 
particular, to real investment and labor employment by nonfinancial 
firms. We analyze whether and to what extent firms are able to 
compensate for the shortage in loan supply by switching banks and by 
using other types of financing. The analysis is based on a unique 
matched data set for Germany that contains firm-level financial 
statements for the 2004-2010 period together with the financial 
statements of each firm's relationship bank(s). We use instrumental 
variable estimations in first differences to eliminate firm- and 
bank-specific effects. The first stage results show that banks that 
suffered losses due to proprietary trading activities at the onset of 
the financial crisis reduced their lending more strongly than 
non-affected banks. In the second stage, we find that firms whose 
relationship banks reduce credit supply downsize their real investment 
and labor employment significantly. This effect is larger for firms that
 are unable to provide much collateral. We document that firms partially
 offset reduced credit supply by establishing new bank relationships, 
using internal funds, and issuing new equity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11451_abstract">This
 paper examines the relation between international banking flows and 
domestic credit expansions that end in financial crises ("bad" credit 
booms). It also analyzes the drivers of the two types of international 
banking flows: flows to banks and flows to non-banks. Based on a sample 
of 80 countries from 1980 to 2012, the results indicate that 
international banking flows to banks are related to bad credit booms, 
while flows to non-banks are not. The paper also shows that the 
composition of the international bank lending is driven by the 
monitoring effort exerted by international banks. The borrowing sector 
perceived as "safer" will be less monitored by the international banks 
and, since monitoring is costly, it is optimal for the international 
bank to place more funds on the safer sector.  Thus, countries with 
mechanisms in place to make the banking sector safer - such as 
government guarantees, fiscal capacity to execute them, and high 
institutional quality - will receive more interbank funds from abroad, 
which increases these countries' vulnerability to bad credit booms.</div>

 We develop a theory of endogenous uncertainty where the ability of 
investors to learn about firm-level fundamentals declines during 
financial crises. At the same time, higher uncertainty reinforces 
financial distress of firms, giving rise to “belief traps”---a 
persistent cycle of uncertainty, pessimistic expectations, and financial
 constraints, through which a temporary shortage of funds can develop 
into a long-lasting funding problem for firms. At the macro-level, 
belief traps provide a rationale for the long-lasting recessions that 
typically entail financial crises. In our model, financial crises are 
characterized by high levels of credit misallocation, an increased 
cross-sectional dispersion of growth rates, endogenously increased 
pessimism, uncertainty and disagreement among investors, highly volatile
 asset prices, and high risk premia. A calibration of our model to 
U.S.&nbsp;micro data on investor beliefs matches the slow recovery after
 the 08/09 crisis quite well.</div>

leading to return differentials across countries. We take the

 females graduate high school and complete college at higher rates than 
U.S. males, but the female-male educational advantage is far larger 
among black and low-SES students than among white and high-SES students.
 We explore why the female advantage in educational attainment is 
systematically larger among minority and low-SES households, focusing on
 three hypotheses: boys are differentially sensitive to family 
disadvantage (what we term the 'Fragile-Y' effect), so that given 
variation in family disadvantage generates greater dispersion in 
behavioral and academic outcomes among boys than girls; girls in 
disadvantaged families receive larger family investments than boys; and 
girls born to disadvantaged families have superior health at birth 
relative to boys. We distinguish these mechanisms by exploiting a unique
 matched database of birth certificate, and academic, disciplinary, and 
high school graduation records for over one million children born in 
Florida between 1994 and 2002. To account for unobserved heterogeneity 
across families, we contrast outcomes of opposite-sex siblings linked by
 public school records to the same mother. Relative to their sisters, 
boys born to low-education and unmarried mothers, raised in low-income 
neighborhoods, and enrolled at poor-quality public schools, have a 
higher incidence of truancy and behavioral problems throughout 
elementary and middle school, perform worse on standardized tests, and 
are less likely to graduate high school. These findings are strongly 
supportive of the differential sensitivity and differential investment 
hypotheses. By contrast, family structure and neighborhood attributes 
have no measurable relationship to the sibling gender gap in birth 
outcomes, including birthweight, APGAR scores, prenatal care adequacy, 
and maternal health, suggesting that post-natal rather than pre-natal 
factors cause the gender-SES gradient in behavioral and educational 
outcomes. A surprising implication of these findings is that relative to
 white siblings, black boys fare worse than their sisters in substantial
 part because black children---both boys and girls---are raised in more 
disadvantaged family environments.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13398_abstract">Consider
 a strategic environment where we fix some initial information structure
 for the players.  Suppose that a sender wants to give the players 
additional information in order to influence players’ choices.  We have 
shown in earlier work the set of outcomes that can be induced 
corresponds to the set of Bayes correlated equilibria of the underlying 
game.  
Thus we provide an approach for studying a many receiver version of 
“Bayesian Persuasion” by Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011) where receivers 
have prior information.  We illustrate the approach (and relate it to 
our prior work) by (i) analyzing a stylized model of bank runs and (ii) 
games of strategic substitutes and complements. We show that the best 
information design in games with strategic substitutes requires the 
agents to receive private and idiosyncratic information, whereas in 
games with strategic complements the socially optimal information 
requires public and common information.  We highlight the importance of 
different assumptions about what the sender knows about the receivers’ 
prior information.</div>

 experts play crucial roles in the modern economy, providing people with
 professional opinions to mitigate information asymmetries. Credit 
rating agencies (CRAs) provide a leading example, generating large 
controversy for possibly contributing to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
 Many questions surround CRAs. Why do investors rely on credit ratings 
to make investment decisions, even though they understand that credit 
ratings may be inflated? How do CRAs affect the real economy, and how 
should they be regulated?

We develop a model in which an informed CRA publishes credit ratings to 
persuade creditors to roll over short-term debt. Observing the credit 
rating, creditors with heterogeneous private information about a firm’s 
liquidity management ability simultaneously make rollover decisions. 
Creditors’ behavior affects the firm’s financial cost and thus its 
investment choice, which determines the CRA’s credit ratings.

In the unique equilibrium, credit ratings are commonly known to be 
inflated, but still provide positive signals. Because the CRA never 
wants to be caught lying, and the firm’s early default choice is 
verifiable, a strong credit rating implies that the firm’s fundamentals 
are not extremely bad. The inflated ratings may either hurt or improve 
overall welfare. The inflated credit rating, together with creditors’ 
dispersed beliefs and strategic complementarities, reduce the firm’s 
financial cost, helping to avoid an inefficient run but also 
incentivizing the firm to gamble for resurrection.

The model predicts that rating inflation increases when firms are more 
opaque, when upside returns from risky projects are higher, and when 
fewer creditors encounter liquidity shocks. We analyze two potential 
policies aiming to regulate CRAs: one involves verifying firms’ 
investment choices and the other involves stress tests. Both policies 
can mitigate the adverse effects of CRAs. One operates via pressuring 
the CRAs to provide more accurate information, and the other one 
operates through weakening the CRAs’ informational role.</div>

 consider dynamic, multi-agent persuasion mechanisms. The agents are 
depositors at a bank which is at risk of default. The bank releases 
public and private information to the agents over time in order to 
prevent them from
coordinating a run on deposits. In such an environment information 
disclosures control not just the agents beliefs about the underlying 
state (here the health of the bank) but also their higher-order beliefs.
 A depositors incentive to withdraw is determined not just by the 
likelihood of default, but also the likelihood that the other depositor 
is already running. Thus, in addition to managing the depositors 
pessimism about default, the bank will try to manage each depositors 
beliefs about the others pessimism. I analyze this problem and show how 
the bank optimally uses private and minimally correlated disclosures to 
achieve this.

In the two agent case there exists a mechanism which is optimal in a 
strong sense: the (random) time at which each agent withdraws as well as
 the time at which the last agent withdraws rst-order stochastically 
dominate all other feasible mechanisms. With more than two agents 
however there is a trade-off and the optimal mechanism depends on the 
bank's payoffs as a function of the number of withdrawing depositors. I 
characterize the maximal delay before a bank run as the number of agents
 tends to innity and as a function of the degree of strategic 
complementarity. When strategic complementarity is weak the delay 
approaches innity asymptotically.</div>

 Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) introduce a way to represent random 
variables as convex functions (integrals of the cumulative distribution 
function). Combining their result with Blackwell's Theorem (1953), we 
characterize the set of distributions of posterior means that can be

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13325_abstract">While
 researchers have collected rich data on career and family outcomes for 
individuals with various levels of human capital, relatively little 
research has studied individual perceptions of how they believe human 
capital would affect their future.  These perceptions, not realized 
actual outcomes, are the key to understanding human capital investments.
 This paper studies how individuals believe human capital investments 
would affect their future career outcomes and family life. We use a 
survey to elicit the beliefs of a high ability sample of currently 
enrolled college students.  The survey includes rich information on 
student beliefs about future earnings, labor supply, marriage, spousal 
characteristics, and fertility, all conditional on college major choice 
and college completion.  We find that students believe that there are 
not only large differences in earnings across potential human capital 
investments, but also they believe there are large differences in 
non-pecuniary aspects of human capital as well, including consequences 
for labor supply, marriage, types of spouses, and the timing and number 
of children.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13326_abstract">This
 paper investigates the determinants of college attrition in a setting 
where individuals have imperfect information about their schooling 
ability and labor market productivity. We estimate a dynamic structural 
model of schooling and work decisions, where high school graduates 
choose a bundle of education and work combinations. We take into account
 the heterogeneity in schooling investments by distinguishing between 
two- and four-year colleges and graduate school, as well as science and 
non-science majors for four-year colleges. Individuals may also choose 
whether to work full-time, part-time, or not at all. A key feature of 
our approach is to account for correlated learning through college 
grades and wages, thus implying that individuals may leave or re-enter 
college as a result of the arrival of new information on their ability 
and productivity. We use our results to quantify the importance of 
informational frictions in explaining the observed school-to-work 
transitions and to examine sorting patterns.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13327_abstract">In
 this paper we present the results of a large scale evaluation of an 
information/persuasive social marketing campaign.  This policy 
implementation and evaluation was conducted in conjunction with the 
government of the Dominican Republic and had the objective of lowering 
high school dropout rates. The evaluation includes 25% of all public 
schools with middle school students and provides information on the 
returns to education, the availability of financial aid and also contain
 non informative persuasive content. The information was provided 
through a series of four 20min videos with a telenovela format that 
include info graphic segments and are shown in school to students in 7th
 and 8th grade. We develop the videos so that we can differentiate a 
treatment that has no statistical facts at all but is otherwise 
identical to an informative series of videos that include info graphic 
information on earnings. We use a baseline and follow up survey covering
 40,000 students to measure how self reported beliefs change regarding 
expected returns for self vs the population, beliefs regarding the 
feasibility of different options and more generally how students 
educational plans change with the treatment. In addition we develop an 
interactive survey application that explains the statistical concepts 
that are then asked in a repeated panel form as in Wiswall and Zafar 
(2015). This allows us to elicit detailed information about expectations
 and model the different mechanisms through which this policy affects 
outcomes. In particular we differentiate between salience of options, 
updating regarding the dispersion of earnings, updating regarding the 
conditional distribution of earnings given education and the change in 
feasibility or availability of options.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10257_abstract">How
 important is mastering information and communications technology (ICT) 
in modern labor markets? Previous research offers no guidance in 
assessing the labor-market returns to ICT skills, primarily because 
skill data have been unavailable. We draw on unique data that provide 
internationally comparable information on ICT skills in 19 countries to 
estimate the returns to ICT skills. Our main identification strategy 
uses cross-country variation in the technologically determined 
probability of having Internet access as a source of exogenous variation
 in ICT skills. This strategy rests on the assumption that ICT skills 
are developed by performing ICT-related tasks, while having access to 
the Internet is a precondition for this type of learning-by-doing. 

Our results show that ICT skills are substantially rewarded in the labor
 market; a one-standard-deviation increase in ICT skills leads to a 17 
percent increase in hourly wages. These estimates also control for a 
rich set of individual-level variables, including a person’s acquired 
level of schooling. Placebo estimations show that exogenous Internet 
availability cannot explain numeracy or literacy skills, suggesting that
 our identifying variation is independent of a person’s general ability.
 We also provide evidence for the learning-by-doing channel through 
which Internet access affects ICT skills by leveraging information in 
the PIAAC data on Internet use at home and at work. 

In addition to the cross-country instrumental variable model, we exploit
 peculiarities in the structure of the pre-existing voice-telephony 
network across German municipalities. The pattern revealed by the 
within-country analysis supports the existence of substantial returns to
 ICT skills in the labor market, which are not confounded by a person’s 
general ability.</div>

 paper investigates how the increasing labor supply of fresh graduates 
with modern IT (information technology) skills impacts the careers of 
incumbent workers during periods of fundamental technological change. To
 identify the causal effect within a difference-in-difference framework,
 we exploit a regulatory change in a mandatory German apprenticeship 
training regulation that obligated fresh graduates of a large 
manufacturing occupation to acquire modern IT skills. By analyzing the 
careers of incumbent workers who graduated shortly before the mandatory 
change in the training regulation occurred, we can investigate how 
incumbent workers respond to the increasing supply of modern-skilled 
fresh graduates. We separate the causal effect from differences in 
unobserved ability, unrelated institutional changes, and macroeconomic 
developments by using a difference-in-differences approach. Thus we 
compare wage trajectories of incumbent workers in the affected 
occupation to wage trajectories of incumbent workers of a comparable 
occupation, which was not affected by a similar regulatory change in 
their training occupation. As workers of both occupations learned and 
work in the same firms, have otherwise similar training contents, 
general schooling requirements,
produce similar goods, and are represented by the same unions, both 
groups are exposed to exactly the same labor market institutions and 
macroeconomic conditions.

The paper shows that fresh graduates with modern IT skills crowd 
incumbent workers out of their jobs and occupations. As a result, even 
young incumbent workers, who lack modern IT skills, experience 
long-lasting earnings reductions. The earnings effects prevail for more 
than 20 years and incumbent workers are more likely to leave their 
occupation or to become unemployed. 

In contrast to most prior studies on skill-biased technological change, 
which relate the timing of important technological innovations and 
relative changes in the level of skills to macroeconomic trends in wage 
inequality, this paper contributes to the literature by providing 
micro-evidence based on a quasi-experimental setting.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10815_abstract">Economic
 theory suggests that agents care for the outcomes they produce. 
Previous experimental research showed that there is indeed a positive 
effect of an underlying mission on employees’ performance. Two competing
 rationales, a pure motivation effect and a sorting effect, might 
explain this outcome: In the first case, workers would provide more 
effort because of doing a mission-oriented job whereas in the second 
case, only a particular subgroup of employees (i.e. more productive or 
highly motivated workers) would select themselves into such a job. By 
conducting a natural field experiment with 129 workers in December 2014,
 we aimed at disentangling the effects of these different channels.

We find that, in line with the previous literature, the scope for effort
 increases through the exogenous provision of mission is small: 
regarding the whole sample, there is no significant difference between 
workers conducting a job with or without an underlying pro-social 
mission given that the task itself was identical. Only workers with – 
according to their CV’s – a very high social commitment were prone to 
react to their job’s mission.

By contrast, we find a widespread and highly significant positive 
performance effect of about 15% if workers were allowed to choose 
between a commercial and a mission-oriented job – the effect is neither 
limited to pro-socially oriented people, high or low ability workers, 
nor a specific gender. Given that there is literally no one who disliked
 the mission and that also less pro-social workers selected themselves 
into the mission-oriented job (41% have never volunteered), the effect 
does not seem to be due to sorting in general. Rather, our study 
highlights the importance of a single aspect of self-selection: the act 
of deliberately making a pro-social choice.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11773_abstract">This
 paper investigates the transferability of human capital across 
countries and the contribution of imperfect human capital portability to
 the explanation of the immigrant-native wage gap. The majority of the 
existing studies on the wage assimilation of immigrants treat education 
and labor market experience obtained in different countries as perfect 
substitutes. Only a few studies allow the returns to human capital to 
vary not only for immigrants and natives, but also according to where 
the human capital was obtained. Therefore, we investigate whether human 
capital accumulated in different countries is rewarded differently in 
the German labor market - an aspect that hitherto has not been dealt 
with. Using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we 
are able to approximate the years of education and labor market 
experience undertaken abroad and in Germany in order to analyze this 
issue. While most of the earlier studies only consider male immigrants, 
we also carry out the analysis for females. Given the immigration 
history of Germany, we examine immigrants by region of origin, arrival 
cohort and whether they consider themselves as temporary or permanent 
migrants. Our results reveal that, overall, education and in particular 
labor market experience accumulated in the home countries of the 
immigrants receive significantly lower returns than human capital 
obtained in Germany. We further find evidence for heterogeneity in the 
returns to human capital of immigrants across countries. Finally, 
imperfect human capital transferability appears to be a major factor in 
explaining the wage differential between natives and immigrants. Our 
results remain stable for various robustness checks, as for instance the
 inclusion of part- and fulltime workers or a Heckman selection 
procedure in order to account for the selective labor market supply of 
women.</div>

 develop a model of monetary policy with two key features: (i) the 
central bank has private information about its long-run target for the 
policy rate; and (ii) the central bank is averse to bond-market 
volatility.  In this setting, discretionary monetary policy is 
gradualist, or inertial, in the sense that the central bank only adjusts
 the policy rate slowly in response to changes in its privately-observed
 target.  Such gradualism reflects an attempt to not spook the bond 
market, but this effort ends up being thwarted in equilibrium, as 
long-term rates rationally react more to a given move in short rates 
when the central bank moves more gradually.  The same desire to mitigate
 bond-market volatility can lead the central bank to lower short rates 
sharply when publicly-observed term premiums rise. In both cases, there 
is a time-consistency problem, and society would be better off 
appointing a central banker who cares less about the bond market.  We 
also discuss the implications of our model for forward guidance once the
 economy is away from the zero lower bound.</div>

 propose and test a new channel for the transmission of monetary policy.
 We show that when the Fed funds rate increases, banks widen the 
interest spreads they charge on deposits, and deposits flow out of the 
banking system. We present a model in which imperfect competition among 
banks gives rise to these relationships.  An increase in the nominal 
interest rate increases banks' market power, inducing them to increase 
deposit spreads and hence restrict deposit supply. Households respond to
 the increase in deposit prices by substituting from deposits into less 
liquid, but higher-yielding assets. Using branch-level data on the 
universe of U.S. banks, we show that following an increase in the Fed 
funds rate, deposit spreads increase by more, and supply falls more, in 
areas with less deposit competition. We control for changes in banks' 
lending opportunities by comparing branches of the same bank in the same
 state.  We control for changes in macroeconomic conditions by showing 
that deposit spreads widen immediately after a rate change and even if 
this change is fully anticipated.  Our results imply that monetary 
policy has a significant impact on how the financial system is funded, 
on the quantity of safe and liquid assets it produces, and on its 
provision of loans to the real economy</div>

 study how compositional effects in the financial sector drive the 
dynamics of aggregate risk-taking and lead to novel effects of financial
 policy interventions. When financial market participants differ in 
their risk-taking, good shock realizations increase the capital of 
high-risk investors more than that of low-risk investors. This raises 
the fraction of wealth controlled by risk-takers in the population and, 
under incomplete markets, increases aggregate risk-taking. The opposite 
conclusions apply for bad shocks. As a result, aggregate risk-taking is 
pro-cyclical, capturing Minsky's financial instability hypothesis that 
"booms sow the seeds of the next crisis." Public policy interventions 
(like financial regulation, bailouts, etc.) work primarily by affecting 
the composition of the financial sector, in contrast to the static 
restriction on choice sets that is the focus of most conventional 
economic frameworks. Interventions to stabilize aggregate risk-taking 
bring the economy closer to the first-best, increasing expected growth 
and reducing aggregate volatility.</div>

 propose a model to explain why banks’ balances sheets are exposed to 
interest rate risk despite the existence of markets where that risk can 
be hedged. A rise in nominal interest rates raises the opportunity cost 
of holding currency; since bank liabilities are close substitutes of 
currency, demand for bank liabilities rises and banks earn higher 
spreads. If risk aversion is higher than 1, the optimal dynamic hedging 
strategy is to sustain capital losses when nominal interest rates rise 
and, conversely, capital gains when they fall. A traditional bank 
balance sheet with long duration nominal assets achieves that. If the 
production side of the economy is sensitive to the distribution of 
wealth between banks and the rest of the economy, this could create 
debt-deflation dynamics.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11364_abstract">This
 paper tests whether and how differences in education policies affect 
migration across Europe. We focus on two policies: (i) increasing the 
length of compulsory education and (ii) introducing  foreign languages 
into compulsory school curricula. The former shifts educational 
attainment for a significant fraction of the population from low towards
 medium levels. Using cohort data on migration flows across European  
countries we find that an additional year of compulsory education 
significantly reduces the number of emigrants. This is in line with 
lower emigration rates of medium educated individuals compared to low 
educated in the majority of European countries. A model in which 
transferring education across countries is costly gives rise to this 
result and is also able to replicate the empirical u-shaped pattern of 
migration by education, with high educated also migrating more than 
medium educated.  We find that introducing a foreign language into 
compulsory school curricula more than doubles the number of emigrants to
 the country where the language is spoken. Therefore, depending on the 
specific content of an education policy, ``more education'' can have 
very different implications for migration.</div>

 provides firms with opportunities for internationalization and growth. 
But, offshoring comes at a cost, especially in presence of inadequate 
information and trust friction. Immigrant employees could reduce such 
offshoring transaction costs through their knowledge of former home 
countries and via access to foreign networks. This is the first 
firm-level study on migration and offshoring. In estimating a firm-level
 gravity model on new employer-employee data for approximately 12,000 
Swedish firms during the time period 1998-2007, we are able to show that
 immigrant employees have a significant positive impact on offshoring. 
Hiring one additional foreign-born worker can spur offshoring with up to
 three percent on average, and even more to low-income countries. Our 
results provide support for the predictions of theory that immigrants 
reduce offshoring costs in terms of matching problems, incomplete 
contracts, moral hazard and asymmetric information. The findings of this
 study could have potentially important policy implications. In addition
 to showing that immigrants could provide options for countries that aim
 to promote offshoring, the results introduce a completely new channel 
through which migration may promote development, through offshoring. 
This could encourage governments of developed nations to enhance their 
emphasis on migration as a tool for supporting private sector 
development in emerging economies.</div>

 Using 2008 and 2009 RUMiC data pooling urban, rural and migrant

experiencing a hukou change make similar investments in human capital as
 the children of native urban hukou holders, suggesting that leveling 
the hukou status amongst children in an urban area may be a first step 
towards reducing intergenerational inequality.</div>

 a unique dataset of the Netflix video on demand library, this article 
measures the characteristics of information goods important for 
strategically employing a mixed bundling strategy.  By matching the 
titles entering and exiting the library to their relevant properties, I 
use a characteristic approach to determine when the value to Netflix of 
adding a title exceeds the licensing fee and when the displacement 
effect associated with a presence in the library dictates that the title
 will be offered only as a pure component.  Results show that new 
products are more profitable to bundle, but are offered for shorter 
lengths of time, and that titles of median commercial success are 
bundled more frequently than the most and least successful.  The number 
of similar films exiting the library is important to how likely a film 
is to enter, indicating strategic bundling.  These results are 
generalizable to the streaming video industry and any information goods 
with rapidly diminishing marginal utility.</div>

 paper highlights an important aspect of online shopping: When buying at
 online shops, consumers incur a non-monetary 'registration cost' caused
 privacy and security concerns and by the time it needs to set up a user
 account. Privacy concerns have become increasingly important in 
e-commerce where buying usually requires the disclosure of address and 
payment information. We show that firms have an incentive to shift this 
registration cost to an earlier stage of the shopping process and detach
 it from the actual buying decision, which has implications for the 
firms' platform design. Intuitively, making the registration cost sunk 
at the point in time when consumers decide to buy increases the 
consumers' willingness to buy, for instance, when credit card 
information is already entered and stored in the consumer's user 
account. 
In our model, the consumers are ex ante uncertain about the price and 
their product valuation. This information can be released to the 
consumers at zero cost. Firms decide when to release this information: 
before or after the consumer has signed in to the website. We show that a
 monopoly firm's equilibrium platform choice involves ex ante 
registration requirements unless privacy and security concerns become 
very important. This result is reinforced when incorporating future 
purchases with the same user account or an informational value of 
consumer registration to the firm. Moreover, it is robust to introducing
 price competition; in particular, firms with loyal consumers benefit 
from requiring ex ante registration. We also show that discounts (store 
credit) can increase the share of consumers who register and hence a 
firm's profit even though discounts distort the equilibrium price, which
 the consumers anticipate. Overall, the choice of the timing of when the
 'registration cost' has to be incurred is an important additional 
instrument for platform design in online markets, which is not available
 in traditional markets and for other types of transaction costs.</div>

 study the implications of introducing a market for leaked personalized 
information. An agent wants to reveal her own type to another party in 
order to receive the best possible treatment. But the information about 
her type may also be relevant for a third party whose reaction may harm 
the agent. The existence of a market where the revealed information is 
traded enables a sorting effect that is adverse for the agent: the 
information is allocated to those types of third parties who harm the 
agent most. The agent therefore rationally reveals only little 
information about her type. However, a naive provision of infor- mation 
to the market harms not only the naive agent herself but also the more 
sophisticated agent who acts in the same role. Moreover, we show that 
the agent may benefit from the introduction of oligopolistic competition
 in the market for information, relative to a monopolistic market.</div>

base: the use of coupons. We develop a model of consumer demand to ask whether firms can indeed
use coupons as a means to price discriminate by attracting new consumers without losing (cannibalizing)
revenue from existing ones, and whether these consumers return to the firm after the price promotion.
In addition, we ask what types of businesses are most likely to benefit from such promotions. We use a
novel method to connect demand for e-coupons through daily-deal sites with regular firm sales. We find
that offering a coupon increases demand both during and after the promotion, suggesting that coupons
can be used both to price discriminate and to advertise. Still, while coupons increase profits on average,
the effect on each firm's profits depends on the type of firm.</div>

 number of studies have demonstrated that employing classroom 
experiments (as opposed to a standard chalk-and-talk pedagogy) has a 
positive effect on student achievement in economics courses.  These 
findings have raised interest in the classroom experiment pedagogy, but 
also questions about the requisite number of experiments and types of 
experiments to achieve these positive outcomes.  We address these 
questions using a sample containing students exposed to varying numbers 
of experiments and a variety of experiment types.  We find that student 
improvement on the TUCE is insensitive to the number of experiments in 
which they participate, but that their final course scores increase with
 experiment participation.  In an attempt to further decompose the 
effect, we investigate the effect of different ranges of experiment 
participation.  We find that students’ change in their TUCE performance 
over the course of the semester is adversely affected (compared to the 
no experiment control group) when students participate in seven or fewer
 experiments and is positively affected by participating in eight or 
more experiments.  Course scores, on the other hand, are positively 
correlated with participating in six or more experiments.   
Participating in experiments illustrating competitive market, market 
structure, market failure, government intervention, and benefits of 
trade are all positively correlated with students’ course score, but 
participation in all except the competitive market and market structure 
experiments are negatively correlated with overall TUCE change measures.</div>

 Assessment in economics is primarily summative in nature, providing 
students with a final measurement of performance. The purposes of 
assessment, however, are more broadly defined than simply measuring 
student achievement and/or assigning grades, and include providing 
self-assessment for students and feedback to instructors. Formative 
assessment practices receive far less attention in the economic 
education literature. We evaluate the efficacy of a blended 
formative/summative assessment tool- the "challenge quiz"- developed to 
support mastery learning by students without placing undue burden on 
instructors. Mastery learning is based on the idea that students should 
demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of a set of ideas before moving on 
to new topics. Our innovation provides students with an opportunity to 
take a more difficult “challenge” quiz to demonstrate their command of 
the material and improve their grade on regular in-class quizzes. The 
structure of these quizzes (limited opportunity to exercise option, 
automatic grade replacement, and more challenging open-ended essay 
format) motivates students to modify study behaviors (formative 
component) and take responsibility for knowledge acquisition (summative 
component). This mastery-based testing approach serves to bring the 
student's objective of a quality grade in line with the instructor's 
objective of quality learning.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12352_abstract">This
 paper extends Samuelson's theory of optimal government purchases by 
accounting for the contribution of government purchases to macroeconomic
 stabilization. Using a matching model of the macroeconomy, we derive a 
sufficient-statistics formula for optimal government purchases. The 
formula implies that the deviation of optimal government purchases from 
the Samuelson level is proportional to the elasticity of substitution 
between government and personal consumption times the 
government-purchases multiplier times the deviation of the unemployment 
rate from its efficient level. Hence, with a positive multiplier, 
optimal government purchases are above the Samuelson level when 
unemployment is inefficiently high and below it when unemployment is 
inefficiently low. We calibrate the formula to US data. A first 
implication is that US government purchases are optimal with a small 
multiplier of 0.04; if the multiplier is larger, US government purchases
 are not countercyclical enough. Another implication is that optimal 
government purchases significantly increase during recessions. With a 
multiplier of 0.5 the optimal government purchases-output ratio 
increases from 16.6% to 20.0% when the unemployment rate rises from the 
US average of 5.9% to 9%. With multipliers higher than 0.5 the optimal 
ratio increases less because fewer government purchases are required to 
fill the unemployment gap: with a multiplier of 2 the optimal ratio only
 increases from 16.6% to 17.6%; this is the same increase as with a 
multiplier of 0.07.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12353_abstract">This
 paper studies how higher-order income risk varies over the business 
cycle as well as the extent to which such risks can be smoothed within 
households or with government social insurance policies. To provide a 
broad perspective on these questions, we study panel data on individuals
 and households from the United States, Germany, and Sweden, covering 
more than three decades of data for each country. We find that the 
underlying variation in higher-order risk is remarkably similar across 
these countries that differ in many details of their labor markets. In 
particular, in all three countries, the variance of earnings shocks is 
almost entirely constant over the business cycle, whereas the skewness 
of these shocks becomes much more negative in recessions. Government 
provided insurance, in the form of unemployment insurance, welfare 
benefits, aid to low income households, and the like, plays a more 
important role reducing downside risk in all three countries; the 
effectiveness is weakest in the United States, and most pronounced in 
Germany. For Sweden, we find that insurance provided within households 
plays a similar role. We calculate that the welfare benefits of social 
insurance policies for stabilizing higher-order income risk over the 
business cycle range from 1% of annual consumption for the United States
 to 5% for Germany.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12355_abstract">This
 paper models how transfers, a tax rate on labor income, and the 
distribution of government debt should respond to aggregate shocks when 
markets are incomplete. A planner sets a lump sum transfer and a linear 
tax on labor income in an economy with heterogeneous agents, aggregate 
uncertainty, and a single asset with a possibly risky payoff. Limits to 
redistribution coming from incomplete tax instruments and limits to 
hedging coming from incomplete asset markets affect optimal policies. 
Two forces shape long-run outcomes: the planner's desire to minimize the
 welfare cost of fluctuating transfers, which calls for a negative 
correlation between agents' assets and their skills; and the planner's 
desire to use fluctuations in the return on the traded asset to 
compensate for missing state-contingent securities. In a multi-agent 
model calibrated to match facts about US booms and recessions, the 
planner's preferences about distribution make policies over business 
cycle frequencies differ markedly from Ramsey plans for representative 
agent models.</div>

 evidence on regulatory spillovers in the international setting is 
limited. Addressing this gap is the subject of the multi-study 
initiative of the International Banking Research Network (IBRN).  This 
paper reports on cross-country evidence from studies by approximately 20
 countries:  How do lending, risk-taking, and funding of banks respond 
to prudential policies implemented in home and foreign markets?  What is
 the evidence on the inward transmissions to the domestic economy and 
the outward transmission to foreign economies? The comprehensive 
analysis performed by a team in each country uses micro-banking data for
 the period between 2000 and 2013 and relies on more precise measures of
 prudential regulation than were available to prior researchers studying
 cross-border spillovers. The project is an ideal approach for 
meta-analysis as it brings evidence from detailed examinations, using 
similar methodology, but conducted by distinct IBRN countries using 
their own country’s confidential regulatory data. As researchers apply a
 common research methodology to the experiences of each country and 
common prudential policy database for responses, the IBRN generates 
broadly relevant insights, going well beyond the interesting single

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12887_abstract">Mitigating
 the negative externalities that systemic risk can create for the 
financial system is the goal of macroprudential supervision. In Europe, 
macroprudential supervision is conducted both, at the national and at 
the European level. In principle, national regulators are responsible 
for macroprudential policies. Since the establishment of the Banking 
Union in 2014, the largest banks in the Euro Area are under the direct 
supervision of the European Central Bank (ECB). In this capacity, the 
ECB can tighten macroprudential measures implemented at the national 
level. In this paper, we ask whether the drivers of systemic risk differ
 when applying a national versus a European perspective. We use market 
data for about 100 listed European banks to measure each bank's 
contribution to systemic risk (SRISK) at the national and at the Euro 
Area level. Our research has three main findings. First, on average, 
systemic risk has increased during the financial crisis. The difference 
between systemic risk at the national and the European level is not very
 large but there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity both across 
countries and banks. Second, we explore the drivers of systemic risk. A 
bank’s contribution to systemic risk increases in bank size, in bank 
profitability, and in the share of banks’ nonperforming loans. It 
decreases in the share of loans to total assets and in the importance of
 non-interest income. Third, the qualitative determinants of systemic 
risk are similar at the national and at the European level while the 
quantitative importance of some factors differs.</div>

 federal and local governments rely on shaming penalties to achieve 
policy goals, but little is known about whether these penalties work as 
intended. Shaming penalties may be ineffective or may backfire by 
crowding-out intrinsic motivation. In this paper, we measure the effects
 of shaming penalties in the collection of tax delinquencies. We sent 
letters to 34,344 tax delinquents who owed half a billion dollars in 
three U.S. states. We randomized some of the information contained in 
the letter to vary the salience of financial and shaming penalties. We 
then measure how the salience of these penalties affected subsequent 
re-payment rates. We find that increasing the salience of financial and 
shaming penalties reduces tax delinquency. The effects of shaming 
penalties are only significant for individuals with smaller debts. We 
show that publishing lists with tax delinquents does not seem to affect 
the decision to pay through peer comparisons of the amount owed.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11778_abstract">The
 standard economic approach to optimal taxation assumes that when 
financial resources are transferred from one group to another, the group
 giving up resources is necessarily made worse off. Building on recent 
behavioral and experimental economics work on social preferences, we 
show that this may not always be the case. We use theory and empirical 
evidence to investigate the extent to which the most widely used social 
preference models can explain people's behavior in tax-like settings, in
 both small and large groups. We conclude that the traditional social 
preferences models are particularly flawed when it comes to 
understanding large group behavior. Even though people show aversion to 
economic inequality in groups of all sizes, people in large groups are 
significantly less willing to make a private, voluntary donation than 
what previous experimental studies have indicated.  Our results suggest 
that redistributive taxation can serve as an important social 
coordination mechanism: many high income earners can be made better off 
when inequality is reduced through mandatory taxation, while at the same
 time most would not be willing to make a private, voluntary donation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11779_abstract">A
 large literature studies the design of income taxes, typically relying 
on the assumption that people's responses to taxes are optimal. However,
 taxpayer behavior is governed by perceptions of taxes, rather than the 
taxes that are actually in place, and thus a precise understanding of 
taxpayer (mis)perceptions is crucial for policy design (cf. Farhi and 
Gabaix 2015). This paper reports a new survey experiment—studying 5000 
American taxpayers approximating the US adult population—designed to 
provide a direct assessment of heuristic perceptions of the US federal 
income tax. In the survey experiment, participants are asked a series of
 questions about the tax that would be owed by a hypothetical taxpayer. 
This taxpayer is nearly identical to the participant in all ways, but 
household income is varied across questions. The new richness of this 
design enables direct tests and quantifications of heuristic perceptions
 that are not possible with existing observational or survey data. In 
particular, we distinguish between, and separately quantify, systematic 
biases arising from an over-reliance on own average tax rate 
(“ironing”), own marginal tax rate (“spotlighting”), and generic over- 
or under-estimation of tax rates. We find that tax perceptions are well 
explained by a model with about three-quarters weight on the true tax, 
one-quarter weight on the forecast of an ironing heuristic, no 
spotlighting, and some residual overestimation of taxes on low incomes 
and underestimation of taxes on high incomes. We also find that 
over-reliance on average tax rates is most prevalent amongst consumers 
who are not financially literate, have low educational attainment, and 
do not file their taxes themselves. Using our estimates, we study the 
implications for informational nudges and optimal tax design, showing 
that 1) informational nudges increase social welfare when applied to 
low-income taxpayers but decrease social welfare when applied to 
high-income taxpayers, and that 2) accounting for ironing implies the 
optimality of more progressive tax schedules.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11780_abstract">Recent
 research suggests that consumers fail to fully account for taxes that 
are not included in the displayed price of the taxed good – and are, 
therefore, less “salient”. In this paper, we move past the question of 
whether individuals behave differently when facing high- versus 
low-salience taxes and instead investigate a potential determinant for 
whether taxpayers account for low-salience taxes when making purchasing 
decisions: the magnitude of the tax being levied. The relationship 
between attention and tax size is important for two reasons. First, it 
can help differentiate two models of decision-making. On the one hand, 
biases may be hard-wired and thus insensitive to features of the 
decision-making environment (including the size of the tax). In 
contrast, a bounded-rationality model of tax salience would suggest that
 consumers become more attentive when facing higher taxes since the 
costs of the mistake are higher. Second, research suggests that 
low-salience tax instruments may offer efficiency and distributional 
benefits. However, the potential benefits are limited by the extent to 
which consumers become more attentive to higher tax rates. To 
investigate the relationship between taxpayer attentiveness and the 
utility cost of ignoring the tax, we designed a lab experiment with real
 stakes designed to simulate an online shopping environment. Subjects 
were randomly assigned to a tax treatment (tax-inclusive or 
tax-exclusive prices) and a tax rate (high (22%) or low (8%)). By 
observing changes in subjects' expenditures at tax-exclusive versus 
tax-inclusive prices, at the low versus high tax rates, we can back out 
changes in subjects' attentiveness to the taxes. Our results provide no 
support to the hypothesis that inattentiveness to low-salience taxes 
decreases as the tax size decreases. This suggest that taxpayers respond
 differently to high- and low-salience taxes even when commodity tax 
rates are substantially greater than the U.S. current ones.</div>

 have argued that a change in policy could transform the not-so-great 
American economic recovery of recent years into a great recovery of the 
kind experienced following earlier financials crises.  Yet some argue 
that it’s too late: if you missed the fast growth of a V-shaped recovery
 at the start, you’re not going to get it now.  In this paper I show 
that the current position of the economy is like the bottom of a 
recession. The labor force participation rate has declined for every 
year of the recovery and is lower than at the bottom of the recession.  
Productivity growth has averaged only .9 percent per year for the past 5
 years, less than half the 2.4% rate of the previous 20 years.  From 
this position a change in policy can generate a post-recession-like boom
 for several years and a higher steady state growth rate thereafter.</div>

because individuals have the resources needed to adapt to their environment. We test this idea in the
wealthiest economy in human history. Using within-county variation in weather, we estimate the effect
of daily temperature on annual income in United States counties over a 40-year period. We find that
this single environmental parameter continues to play a large role in overall economic performance:
productivity of individual days declines roughly 1.7% for each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in daily average
temperature above 15°C (59°F). A weekday above 30°C (86°F) costs an average county $20 per person.
Hot weekends have little effect. These estimates are net of many forms of adaptation, such as factor
reallocation, defensive investments, transfers, and price changes. Because the effect of temperature
has not changed since 1969, we infer that recent uptake or innovation in adaptation measures have
been limited. The non-linearity of the effect on different components of income suggest that temperature
matters because it reduces the productivity of the economy's basic elements, such as workers and crops.
If counties could choose daily temperatures to maximize output, rather than accepting their geographically determined
endowment, we estimate that annual income growth would rise by 1.7 percentage points.
Applying our estimates to a distribution of "business as usual" climate change projections indicates
that warmer daily temperatures will lower annual growth by 0.06-0.16 percentage points in the United
States unless populations engage in new forms of adaptation.</div>

 is a growing body of research literature that uses various modeling 
techniques to examine how weather and climate affect various economic 
outcomes.  Weather and climate variables have been shown to impact 
agriculture, industrial output, labor productivity, energy demand, 
health, current employment statistics as well as other measures of

overview of existing data sets that are useful for economic modeling.  
In addition there are several new data sets now being developed at the

 Every environmental data set has attributes that make it attractive to 
users, but will likely have some issues that users needs to be aware of.
  For example, the number of stations in a given region usually changes 
over time or the observational methods may change.  These changes may or
 may not have an effect on a particular application or project, but it 
is important for the investigator to be aware of such issues.  One 
possible barrier to effective collaboration between economists and 
atmospheric scientists is vocabulary and jargon.  Some of the known 
disconnects between economic and weather vocabularies are discussed.  A 
final desired outcome of this presentation is to open a dialogue between
 scientists at the NCEI and the economic community to enhance the 
usability and guide future development of weather and climate data sets.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12982_abstract">Building
 on Bloesch and Gourio (2015), this paper measures the sensitivity of 
various economic activity measures to weather shocks at the state level 
using a large panel data set. We find strong evidence of weather effect 
on monthly economic indicators, but these are quickly reversed the next 
month. We also find that these effects are highly heterogeneous. 
Notably, the effect of an inch of snowfall is strongly negatively 
related to the average snowfall in the state. This has consequences for 
the appropriate weighting of weather data for aggregate forecasting. We 
provide estimates of the historical effect of temperature and snowfall.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20801_abstract">This
 paper investigates how executive employment contracts influence 
corporate financial policies during the final year of the contract term,
 using a new, hand-collected data set of CEO employment agreements. On 
the one hand, the impending expiration of fixed-term employment 
contracts creates incentives for CEOs to engage in strategic 
window-dressing activities. We find that, compared to normal periods, 
CEOs manage earnings more aggressively when they are in the process of 
contract renegotiations. Correspondingly, during CEO contract renewal 
times, firms are more likely to report earnings that meet or narrowly 
beat analyst consensus forecasts. Moreover, CEOs also reduce the amount 
of negative firm news released during their contract negotiation years. 
On the other hand, we find that merger and acquisition deals announced 
during the contract renegotiation year yield higher announcement returns
 than deals announced during other periods, suggesting that the upcoming
 contract expiration and renewal can also have disciplinary effects on 
potential value-destroying behaviors of CEOs. In addition, we show that 
firms whose CEOs are not subject to contract renewal pressure do not 
experience such corporate policy changes and that CEOs who engage in 
manipulation during contract renewal obtain better employment terms in 
their new contracts, in terms of contract length, severance payment, and
 salary and bonus. Overall, our results indicate that job uncertainty 
created by expiring employment contracts induces changes in managerial 
behaviors that have significant impacts on firm financial activities and
 outcomes.</div>

managers take value-destroying actions that reduce their firms’ stock 
volatility and risk of distress. To illustrate one such action, we show 
that managers undertake diversifying acquisitions that target firms 
likely to reduce risk, have negative announcement returns, and are 
concentrated among firms whose managers gain the most from reducing 
risk. Our findings suggest that instruments typically used to motivate 
managers, like greater financial leverage and larger ownership stakes,

 examine whether financial analysts curb firms' socially irresponsible 
activities, relying on brokerage closures and mergers as natural 
experiments that create exogenous drop in analyst coverage. Our

 theory suggests that time variation in the degree to which leverage 
constraints bind affects the pricing kernel. We propose a demand-based 
measure for this leverage constraint tightness by inverting the argument
 that constrained investors tilt their portfolios to riskier assets. We 
show that the average market beta of actively managed mutual funds -- 
intermediaries facing leverage restrictions -- captures their borrowing 
demand and thus the tightness of leverage constraints. Consistent with 
theory, it strongly predicts returns of the betting-against-beta 
portfolio, and is a priced risk factor in the cross-section of mutual 
funds and stocks. Funds with low exposure to the factor outperform 
high-exposure funds by more than 5% annually, and for stocks this 
difference reaches 7%. Our results show that the tightness of leverage 
constraints has important implications for asset prices.</div>

 identical assets --- especially when markets are less liquid,

 and more layers of intermediaries arise in modern financial markets. 
What determines this chain of intermediation? What are the consequences?
 We analyze these questions in a stylized search model with an

the chain length and the price dispersion among inter-dealer trades are 
decreasing in search cost, search speed, and market size, but increasing
 in investors' trading needs. Using data from the U.S. corporate bond 
market, we find evidence broadly consistent with these predictions. 
Moreover, as the search speed goes to infinity, our search-market 
equilibrium does not always converge to the centralized-market 
equilibrium. In the case with an intermediary sector, prices and 
allocations converge, but the trading volume remains higher than that in
 a centralized-market equilibrium. This volume difference goes to

 fees are a strong predictor of the cross-section of stock returns, both
 gross and net of fees. We document a large ``shorting premium'':  the 
cheap-minus-expensive-to-short (CME) portfolio of stocks has a monthly 
average gross return of 1.31%, a net-of-fees return of 0.78%, and a 
1.44% four-factor alpha. We show that short fees interact strongly with 
the returns to eight of the largest and most well-known cross-sectional 
anomalies. The anomalies effectively disappear within the 80% of stocks 
that have low short fees, but are greatly amplified among those with 
high fees. We propose a joint explanation for these findings: the 
shorting premium is compensation for the concentrated short risk borne 
by the small fraction of investors who do most shorting. Because it is 
on the short side, it raises prices rather than lowers them. We proxy 
for this short risk using the CME portfolio return and demonstrate that a
 Fama-French + CME factor model largely captures the anomaly returns

 paper uncovers strong return reversals in the US value weighted stock 
market index around the last monthly settlement day, T-3, which 
guarantees liquidity for month-end cash distributions. Similar reversals
 in market returns around T-3 are documented internationally. The return
 reversals are stronger in countries where the mutual fund ownership is 
large, and in the US they have become stronger over time as the mutual 
fund ownership of stocks has increased. Using data that contains all 
trades of a subset of institutional investors, we show direct evidence 
that institutional trading contributes to the market reversals. Finally,
 we find that in the cross-section of stocks, return reversals around 
the turn of the month are stronger for stocks more commonly held by 
mutual funds and for liquid stocks. These market reversals help explain 
the previously documented abnormally high market returns around the turn

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21034_abstract">Leverage
 constraints are an important pillar of bank regulation. Yet, this paper
 argues that in times of economic turmoil affecting a bank's borrower 
base at large, the traditional bank risk measures of leverage and 
capital ratios understate the total increase in bank risk. In a sequence
 of systematic shocks hitting the borrowers, the impact on a bank's 
asset value grows disproportionately with every bump due to the 
concavity of the loan value in the borrower's assets. Although this 
increase in credit exposure cannot be reflected by capital ratios, a 
structural default model can capture the added sensitivity. Using a 
sample of 334 non-financial firms and 27 banks, we demonstrate the 
nonlinear nature of the changes in banks' risk exposures after a series 
of shocks to their borrowers and show that the effect is more severe for
 firms with low ratings. We also simulate the impacts of the same series
 of shocks under different leverage scenarios and are thus able to 
assess the magnitude of asset risk relative to leverage risk. Further it
 appears that the benefit of ex-post deleveraging after a shock is 
limited despite its high cost. The results emphasize the importance of 
systematic risk among borrowers and of the ongoing monitoring of changes
 in economic climate so as to induce banks to provision adequately for 
risk changes.</div>

 attention has been paid to the comparative fate of banks benefiting 
from TARP Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funding and less fortunate 
banks subject to FDIC resolution. We address this omission by 
investigating two core issues. One is whether commercial banks that 
ended up being subject to FDIC resolution received CPP funds. The other 
is whether the non-allocation of CPP funds led viable commercial banks 
into FDIC receivership. Our findings show almost no overlap between 
CPP-funded and FDIC-resolved commercial banks, but we provide evidence 
that a significant number of FDIC-resolved banks could have avoided 
receivership if they had been allocated CPP funding. By comparing 
estimated funding and resolution costs we also show that bailing out 
more banks would have been cost-efficient. While our results do not 
allow for any policy suggestion on the optimality of bail-outs per se, 
they suggest that once a bail-out program is already on the table, it is
 better to err on the side of rescuing too many rather than too few 
banks.</div>

 investigate the transmission of central bank liquidity to bank deposit 
and loan spreads of European firms over the January 2006 to June 2010 
period. When the European Central Bank (ECB) allocated liquidity to 
banks in a competitive tender at the beginning of the crisis, higher 
“aggregate” central bank liquidity (i.e. the total liquidity in the 
banking system that is held at the ECB) reduces bank deposit rates of 
low risk banks but has no effect on deposit rates of high risk banks or 
on corporate loan spreads of high or low risk banks. After the ECB 
started to fully allot all liquidity requested by banks via its 
refinancing operations on October 8, 2008, an increase in liquidity 
decreases deposit rates of both high and low risk banks. While loan 
spreads of low risk banks decrease, those of high risk banks remain 
unchanged also under full allotment of liquidity. We find that borrowers
 of high risk banks refinance term loans drawing down loan commitments. 
They have lower payouts, lower capital expenditures and lower asset 
growth compared with borrowers of low risk banks. Our results suggest a 
differential transmission of central bank liquidity of low versus high 
risk banks, and an impaired transmission to corporate borrowers of high 
risk banks.</div>

 paper assesses whether more effective enforcement of insider trading 
laws increases the rate of technological innovation. Based on over 
100,000 industry-country-year observations across 97 economies from 1976
 to 2006, we find evidence consistent with the view that enforcement of 
insider trading laws spurs innovation—as measured by patent intensity, 
scope, impact, generality, and originality—after controlling for 
country-year and industry fixed effects. Consistent with theory, the 
relationship between innovation and insider trading laws is strongest in
 industries that are naturally innovative, opaque, and dependent on

 analyze the effect of the human capital or “quality” of the top 
management of a firm on its innovation activities. We extract a 
“management quality factor” using common factor analysis on various 
individual proxies for the quality of a firm's management team, such as 
management team size, fraction of managers with MBAs, the average 
employment- and education-based connections of each manager in the 
management team, fraction of members with prior work experience in a top
 management position, the average number of prior board positions that 
each manager serves on, and the fraction of managers with doctoral 
degrees. We find that firms with higher quality management teams not 
only invest more in innovation (as measured by R&amp;D expenditures), 
but also have a greater quantity and quality of innovation, as measured 
by the number of patents and citations per patent, respectively. We 
control for the endogenous matching of higher quality managers and 
higher quality firms using an instrumental variable analysis where we 
use a function of the number of top managers who faced Vietnam War era 
drafts (and therefore had an incentive to go to graduate school to get a
 draft deferment) as an instrument for top management human capital. We 
also show that an important channel through which higher management 
quality firms achieve greater innovation success is by hiring a larger 
number of inventors (controlling for R&amp;D expenditures), and also by 
hiring higher quality inventors (as measured by their prior citations 
per patent record).  Finally, we show that firms with higher quality top
 management teams are able to develop a larger number of both 
exploratory and exploitative innovations.

 a sample of venture capital (VC)-backed initial public offering (IPO) 
firms, we study the effect of financial intermediaries’ tight leash on

intermediaries’ tight leash impedes innovation: IPO firms are 
significantly less innovative when VCs interfere with their development 
more frequently through staging—as measured by a larger number of VC 
financing rounds. To establish causality, we exploit plausibly exogenous
 variation in the frequency of direct flights between VC domiciles and 
IPO firm headquarters that are due to airline restructuring. Our 
identification tests suggest a negative, causal effect of VC staging on 
firm innovation. Furthermore, staging is more detrimental to innovation 
when innovation is more difficult to achieve and when VCs are less 
experienced with the industry in which their entrepreneurial firms 
operate. By documenting a previously under-recognized adverse 
consequence of VC stage financing, our evidence suggests that 
short-termist incentives can be cultivated even in a private equity

 does competition affect innovation and how it is financed in 
R&amp;D-intensive firms? We study the interaction between competition, 
R&amp;D investments, and the financing choices of such firms using data 
on biopharmaceutical firms. To motivate the empirical hypotheses, we 
develop a model for such firms in which their capital structure and 
amounts invested in R&amp;D as well as existing assets are all 
determined in response to the degree of competition in the industry. The
 key predictions are that, as competition increases, such firms will: 
(1) increase R&amp;D investment relative to investment in 
assets-in-place that support existing products; (2) carry more cash and 
maintain less net debt; and (3) experience declining betas but greater 
total stock return volatility due to higher idiosyncratic risk. While 
the focus is on the biopharmaceutical industry, the results are broadly 
applicable to other R&amp;D-intensive industries as well. We provide 
empirical support for these predictions. In order to deal with the 
endogeneity issue introduced by the fact that a firm's R&amp;D 
investments and the product-market competition it faces influence each 
other, we provide further evidence through a differences-in-differences 
analysis.

 to other countries, the U.S. has abnormally few listed firms today 
given its level of economic development and the quality of its 
institutions. We call this the “U.S. listing gap” and show that it is 
consistent with a decrease in the net benefit of a listing for U.S. 
firms. We find that the probability that a firm is listed is lower than 
at the listing peak in 1996 for all firm size categories though more so 
for smaller firms. From 1997 to the end of our sample period in 2012, 
the new list rate is low and the delist rate is high compared to U.S. 
history and to other countries. The high delist rate accounts for 
roughly 46% of the listing gap and the low new list rate for 54%. The 
high delist rate is explained by an unusually high rate of acquisitions 
of publicly-listed firms compared to previous U.S. history and to other 
countries. We rule out industry changes, changes in listing 
requirements, and the reforms of the early 2000s as explanations for the
 gap.</div>

Finally, we use panel data of only the contiguous county-pairs. The main
 finding is that the effect of intrastate bank branching on consumer 
bankruptcy differs according to the research methodology. While, the 
effect is positive and statistically significant using the entire data 
of U.S. counties, it is insignificant for the panel data of contiguous 
county-pairs. As per the permutation test, the overall effect is 
positive, but the positive effect is only found in five of seventeen 
treatment states. Overall, the results provide added perspective to the 
notion that the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings is linked to the 
deregulation in the banking sector.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13795_abstract">This
 paper studies the impacts of two widespread phenomena on home prices in
 down cycles of the real estate market – rampant delisting of properties
 that fail to sell despite genuine marketing effort, and large number of
 motivated sellers who are pressured to sell because of various 
liquidity constraints. While there is a general belief that both these 
factors exert negative impacts on home prices, we extend the literature 
by formally examining such impacts. We provide a set of simple 
quantitative tools that enable analysts to infer the true market 
condition, and sellers to form realistic selling expectations, by 
adjusting the market average to reflect such impact. Empirically, we 
demonstrate that the market average, based solely on sold properties, 
tends to be significantly biased if rampant property delisting exists. 
In addition, sellers under liquidity constraints are expected to receive
 a much lower return and bear higher risk than the market average. The 
findings of this paper can help market participants and policy makers to
 understand the true housing market conditions, especially in the down 
cycles of the market during which proper policy responses are most 
needed.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13796_abstract">Empirical
 evidence suggests that when the market becomes increasingly volatile, 
trading activities may be depressed or even halted. This paper develops a
 model and formally studies the relationship between the market 
volatility and its liquidity in the real estate market. Different 
information structures are examined in the context of a seller-offer, 
ultimatum bargaining game. We show that an increase in the market 
volatility negatively affects its liquidity when information is 
asymmetric between the buyer and the seller. However, market volatility 
has no effect on liquidity under symmetric information when the buyer 
and the seller are either both informed or both uninformed.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13797_abstract">This
 study investigates whether the unprecedented liquidity injected in the 
economy by the U.S Fed through unconventional monetary policy measure, 
popularly known as quantitative easing (QE), is a systematic factor that
 can explain the abnormally low U.S. housing starts of recent years. We 
use housing and mortgage markets data that should capture the liquidity 
induced by QE to construct four unobservable aggregate liquidity factors
 as key channels through which QE stimulus effects might have been 
transmitted to housing and mortgage markets. Using monthly MSA level 
data, we find that expected housing starts are related across time to 
fluctuations in the aggregate liquidity factors. Specifically, we find 
that housing starts liquidity betas, their sensitivities to liquidity 
shocks from QE transmitted through the aggregate liquidity factors 
significantly influence the level of U.S. investments in new single 
family housing between 2005 and 2012. However, we find evidence of 
heterogeneity in the responsiveness of housing starts to innovations in 
the aggregate liquidity factors in that market regimes with high levels 
of land use control (constrained markets) exhibit relatively muted 
sensitivities to fluctuations in the aggregate liquidity factors induced
 by QE. Remarkably, we also find that in the absence of GSE and FHA 
capital market activities that channel credit into housing market the 
contraction in housing starts would have been worse. Further, a build-up
 in single family homes-for-rent, shadow vacancy liquidity risk, exerts a
 down-ward pressure on investments in new single family housing.</div>

 paper introduces Nash bargaining into a search model in order to 
identify various channels through which agent gender affects selling 
price and selling time in the resale market for houses. The theory can 
be used in conjunction with the empirical model to determine agent 
bargaining power and how it is affected by dealing with the same or 
opposite sex agents. A decade of MLS data from Virginia reveals that 
listing agent sex and the mix of listing and selling agents involved in a
 transaction affect prices and liquidity. The bargaining power of agents
 depends on their sex and that of the agent on the other side of the 
transaction, but it also depends on housing market conditions. Female 
selling agents have stronger bargaining power when facing female listing
 agents than when facing male agents in rising or falling markets. The 
bargaining power of male selling agents is stronger when facing female 
listing agents than when facing male agents in the rising market, but it
 is invariant with respect to listing agent sex in the declining market.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13836_abstract">The
 last decade’s boom and bust in U.S. commercial real estate (CRE) prices
 was at least as large as that in the housing market and also had a 
large effect on bank failures. Nevertheless, the role of CRE in the 
Great Recession has received little attention. This study estimates 
cohesive models of short-run and long-run movements in capitalization 
rates (rent-to-price-ratio) and risk premiums across the four major 
types of commercial properties. Results indicate that CRE price 
movements were mainly driven by sharp declines in required risk premia 
during the boom years, followed by sharp increases during the bust 
phase. Using decompositions of estimated long-run equilibrium factors, 
our results imply that much of the decline in CRE risk premiums during 
the boom was associated with weaker regulatory capital requirements. The
 return to normal risk premia levels in 2009 and 2010 was first driven 
by a steep rise in general risk premia that occurred after the onset of 
the Great Recession and later by a tightening of effective capital 
requirements on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) resulting 
from the Dodd-Frank Act. In contrast to the mid-2000s boom, the recovery
 in CRE prices since 2010 has been mainly driven by declines in real 
Treasury yields to unusually low levels. Our findings have important 
implications for the channels through which macro-prudential regulation 
may or may not be effective in limiting unsustainable increases in asset
 prices.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13838_abstract">We
 present a general equilibrium model of a subprime economy characterized
 by limited recourse mortgages, asymmetric borrower credit quality 
information, and mortgage lenders that either own or sell the loans they
 originate. Because portfolio lenders can acquire soft information at 
low cost and are capacity constrained, there is another potential 
funding source for consumers: the conduit loan market. Conduit lenders 
originate mortgages based on hard information only, but have access to 
the securitized investment market. This trade-off between adverse 
selection and secondary market liquidity determines the equilibrium size
 of the portfolio and conduit loan markets in our model. Our theory 
rationalizes the emergence of the subprime conduit mortgage market and 
subsequent collapse of the traditional lending model, and also the 
recent rise and fall of the subprime conduit mortgage market. In 
addition, the model sheds some light on the access to and fragmentation 
of the rental and owner-occupied segments of the housing market, and 
also illustrates how house prices respond to changes in the credit 
scoring technology and mortgage securitization rate, among other things.</div>

 use data from prospectus supplements to measure the complexity of 
securitized products. We find that securities in more complex deals 
default more. The higher likelihood of default is economically 
meaningful: a one standard deviation increase in complexity represents a
 17% increase in default on AAA securities. However, yields of more 
complex securities are not higher indicating that investors do not 
perceive them as riskier. The relation between complexity and default is
 not primarily due to issuers masking low quality loans as it persists 
after controlling for the collateral default rate. Rating agencies are 
more lenient in rating complex deals.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13705_abstract">A
 marked trend in the 21st century higher education academic workforce is
 the growth of contingent and part time academic labor, both in the 
growing for-profit sector as well as in the traditional non-profit 
sector.  This change, which has been unfolding for at least two decades,
 has implications for the employment prospects of Ph.D.’s across the 
disciplines, particularly in fields considered part of the traditional 
liberal arts and sciences, as well as for one of the most highly 
educated workforces in the U.S., college professors. What some have 
dubbed the ‘artisan’ model of education, which relies on labor-intensive
 construction of classes and close mentoring of students, seems to be 
changing to a more transactional delivery of content and provision of 
credential model.  Some analysts have predicted that, as colleges and 
universities continue to struggle with the ‘affordability crisis’ in 
higher education, costs must be further cut by greater use of online 
classes and pre-packaged modules, with the result that the traditional 
full time faculty will become a thing of the past.  If so, university 
education could devolve into a very different system than has existed 
for centuries, serious implications for the future of educated workers 
across the spectrum. We will use Veblen’s critique of the business 
management of universities as a framework for our argument and analysis.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13706_abstract">This
 paper synthesizes institutionalist theories of wage determination for 
teaching pluralist labor economics. They focus on relative bargaining 
power, on productivity which is primarily inherent in the job and on how
 institutions set the context for wage bargaining. The institutionalist 
view of bargaining power goes beyond market structures, such as 
monopsony or collective bargaining. Relative bargaining power, like 
pre-market or social discrimination, is based in a wider context. It is 
shaped by social norms and attitudes about appropriate behavior as well 
as public policies that a) exclude or restrict certain ages or genders 
from the potential labor force, b) separate the potential labor force 
into non-competing groups, c) affect incentives for individuals in 
particular categories to participate in labor supply and d) affect the 
responsibilities of businesses with the workers who produce their goods.
 Where variations in productivity underlie differentials in wages (or 
more correctly, total compensation) this is primarily based in the job 
rather than the individual (see Thurow 1986). Workers in a particular 
job have access to a given quantity and quality of capital and other 
resources and are dependent on revenues brought in for the product or 
service. Individual skills and motivation are valuable in competing for 
the job but cannot affect firm investments in capital or firm demand.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13707_abstract">John
 Kenneth Galbraith follows a long line of institutionalist economists 
who supported the market economy but were critical of its structure and 
it treatment of workers and the poor. This paper looks at Galbraith’s 
view of those structural factors and how they influence the development 
of labor market institutions. 
John Kenneth Galbraith rejected the methodological approach of 
mainstream economics and emphasized an evolutionary process of both 
formal and informal institutions (habits of mind). While best known for 
extensions of Veblenian ‘conspicuous consumption’ and theories of 
corporate behavior, his work reveals also insights about labor. This 
paper will deal with three: Over fifty years ago, Galbraith included the
 work experience in what he called ‘quality of life’ and called for 
translating productivity gains into reduced work hours, greater safety, 
and more satisfying work as well as the higher pay that would provide 
more consumer demand. He also recognized that technological change drove
 new market structures to effectively use specialized knowledge, group 
decision-making and a more advanced division of labor, all of which 
would affect workers, positively or negatively. Thirdly, Galbraith 
realized the need for countervailing power to the large corporation, 
which he saw in unions. They had the ability to bargain for better 
working conditions as well as a more fair structure of wages. Galbraith 
would not be surprised that the developing imbalance of power has led 
large corporations to avoid direct bargaining with workers through 
outsourcing and contracting.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13708_abstract">The
 nature and significance of the relationship between employers and 
employees has always been at the heart of the institutionalist tradition
 in labor economics. In Robert Prasch’s essay “How is Labor Distinct 
from Broccoli?” (The Institutionalist Tradition in Labor Economics, Dell
 P. Champlin and Janet T. Knoedler, eds., 2004), he articulated the 
qualities of labor that define fundamental differences between labor and
 other marketable commodities and make the employment relationship 
uniquely different from other market transactions. He also noted that 
these difference were “once well understood by economists.” 
Consequently, he argued: “It follows that what is needed is not a 
project of discovery so much as one of recovery.” Current labor policy 
discussions focus our attention once again on the relationship between 
employers and employees, as we seek to understand and develop policies 
to address the problems of labor market fissuring, contingent and 
precarious employment, irregular work scheduling, overemployment and 
underemployment. This requires looking “inside institutions” at the 
evolving definitions and relationships of employment. This paper will 
examine the significance and uniqueness of the employment relationship 
in institutional labor economics, and the insights to be gained from 
“rediscovering” this perspective and applying it to the analysis of 
contemporary employment trends, outcomes and policies, as well as 
introducing this analysis as the foundation of labor economics 
education.</div>

 most metrics, the financial crisis of 2007-9 produced the most severe 
recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, but labor market 
outcomes show remarkable differences across the countries of the rich 
world. More specifically, patterns of GDP and productivity growth 
between 2007 and 2014 do a poor job of accounting for differences in 
wage and employment performance during and after the crisis. With a new 
measure of decent jobs (adequate wages and hours), this paper describes 
trends in GDP, productivity growth, the decent job share of employment, 
the low wage share, and the real wage by gender and large economic 
sector for the US, Canada, the UK, France and Germany. It then considers
 these trends in light of cross-country differences in how labor markets
 function, with the labor market understood not just in terms of the 
interaction of labor supply and demand, but more broadly as the set of 
social mechanisms that coordinate terms of employment. These mechanisms 
are called for convenience “institutions”, which include not just legal 
and informal rules and social norms, but also the consequential actions 
of organizations (e.g., government policies and programs, and the 
policies of firms, trade unions and advocacy organizations) and the 
effects of social structures (e.g., race, gender and immigration 
dynamics).</div>

 gap between the economic theory of action and the practical reality of 
choice (analyzed in the Aristotelian practical wisdom tradition) cannot 
be bridged through the development of more complex models. This poses a 
challenge for the use of economic models for policy analysis: they 
cannot help but leave out of their formal analysis aspects of actual 
decision making (practical wisdom) which are crucial to the operation of
 the economy. Insights from three different treatments of the gap 
between the formal analysis of choice and the reality of human behavior 
(Suchman’s studies of human-machine interaction, Scott’s analysis of 
mētis, and Vernon Smith’s studies of ecological rationality) offer 
guidance for how economists might modify the insights of their models of
 choice when offering policy advice.</div>

 Smith and, even more, for James Mill, factions are associated with 
zero-sum outcomes. In Mill’s view, unchecked power is the means by which
 an individual or a group promotes its interest to the detriment of 
others. In the context of the financial crisis this played out as those 
within the circle of front running traders such as Bernie Madoff were 
well aware of the front running, of taking from some – outside the 
faction – to benefit those on the inside of the faction. This paper, 
accordingly, explores the darker side of sympathy in classical economic

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14269_abstract">This
 paper centres around the basic proposition that societies with strong 
economic democracy are more likely to achieve crucial public policy 
goals; such as combating climate change, reducing inequalities and 
creating more sustainable forms of economic activity.  In doing so, we 
attempt to construct an index of economic democracy (EDI) as both a tool
 to test the basic proposition and as a key indicator of individual 
country performance in the pursuit of open and democratic governance of 
the economy.  A key argument advanced here is that dominant economic 
policy regimes in many OECD countries - where decision making is 
increasingly monopolised and centralised among financial and economic 
elites and “experts” - have had negative effects in terms of greater 
income and wealth equalities, increasing susceptibility to financial 
crises and fragility, and arguably a failure to effectively address the 
causes of climate change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We make a broad definition of economic democracy – employing four 
dimensions: (i) workplace (nature and structure of employment relations,
 levels of co-determination, etc); (ii) degree of associational economic
 governance (e.g. level of cooperatives within economy, number and 
extent of business and labour associations in economic policy forums); 
(iii) distribution of economic decision-making powers across space and 
sector (e.g. ownership structure, size structure of firms, spatial 
division of labour between regions); (iv) transparency, openness and 
democratic engagement of broader population in macro-economic 
decision-making (e.g. central bank governance structures).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In articulating our case, we draw from the work of John Dewey (1963), 
for example, in emphasising the deliberative aspect of economic 
democracy.  We anticipate that greater economic democracy does not 
resonate with financialisation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14385_abstract">We
 report results from the first (to our knowledge) randomized controlled 
trial to test the impact of water-efficient technology adoption on water
 use. Encouraging humans to adopt technologies that use less water per 
unit of activity has been highlighted in numerous government and 
multilateral plans as a key component of climate change adaptation 
strategies. For example, a State of California report (2008) urges the 
region to “aggressively increase water use efficiency” for climate 
change adaptation. In a drought-prone area of Central America that is 
forecasted to experience more frequent droughts in the future, engineers
 have estimated that more efficient technologies in rural homes will 
reduce water use by almost 25%. Two prominent reasons why such 
technologies will not reduce water use by as much as engineers predict 
are: (a) residents change their behavior in response to the new 
technology (as one might see in the energy efficiency context); and (b) 
disadoption of the technology. We randomly offered free water-efficient 
technology and installation to over one thousand rural residential homes
 who expressed an interest in acquiring the technology. To test 
hypotheses related to disadoption, we also randomly required some 
households to hand over their old technology to the implementers prior 
to receiving the new technology, and randomly offered some households a 
performance bonus for continuing to use the technology for up to six 
months. We conducted audits of households 5-6 months after treatment 
assignment to determine if the technologies remain installed. These 
additional treatments are used to test the popular hypothesis that 
people disadopt resource-conserving technologies because of insufficient
 time with the technology, which prevents them from reducing the 
marginal costs (learning by doing) and forming more accurate beliefs 
about the marginal benefits (learning by observing).</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14386_abstract">To
 date, the energy savings from energy-efficiency building retrofits are 
assessed using ex-ante engineering models. This paper provides the first
 evaluation of engineering models that uses residential billing data, 
combined with data on observable characteristics of each residence, to 
assess the accuracy of engineering predictions across nine retrofit 
technologies used in Gainesville, Florida.

The analysis combines three central datasets including (i) an eight-year
 panel of household-level monthly electricity and natural-gas 
consumption data for 30,000 residences in the Gainesville Regional 
Utility service area from 2004 to 2012, (ii) information about the type 
and timing of retrofits for over 12,000 rebate program participants from
 2008 to 2012, (iii) household-level engineering predictions of energy 
savings for each program participant.

To evaluate average energy savings of DSM programs using 
quasi-experimental techniques, I employ a two-way fixed effect model, 
where a panel of monthly energy bills is used to eliminate time-constant
 features of each residence. As a further innovation, I exploit 
differences in the timing of retrofit installation during the five-year 
rebate program. To identify treatment effects for early retrofits 
installed at time t, I use a control group made of future program 
participants that have not yet installed retrofits at time t. By using 
only treated households, I eliminate bias introduced from participant 
self-selection.

Results indicate that household engineering models are surprisingly 
accurate, a finding that contrasts sharply with literature validating 
aggregate engineering models. In four of nine retrofit programs, 
engineering models predicted energy savings within 20% of actual energy 
reduction (pool-pump replacement, refrigerator removal, duct repair). 
However, engineering bias vary in direction and magnitude across 
retrofit technologies. For the remaining five programs, engineering 
biases range from 60% under prediction (central air-conditioner), to 
100% over prediction (attic insulation, air-conditioner maintenance) – 
modest biases that are 5 times smaller than those cited in previous 
literature.</div>

 advanced, community-level drinking water treatment facilities are 
increasingly seen as water
supply solutions in locations where piped in-house water systems are 
nonexistent or unreliable. These
systems utilize combined technologies, such as advanced filtration plus 
ultraviolet disinfection or
reverse osmosis, which are known to be highly effective for the removal 
of pathogens and other water
contaminants. Yet there is a paucity of rigorous evidence on whether the
 community-level treatment
model delivers water quality and health benefits to households that 
source water from them. This paper
utilizes a quasi-experimental approach that combines construction of 
counterfactual groups of
households with a difference-in-differences methodology to examine such 
impacts. We find that only a
little over 10% of households in treatment villages source water from 
the community water systems
(CWS), and there is no evidence of health and water quality benefits 
among households in treated
villages, relative to controls. Furthermore, among users of the CWS (but
 not non-users), we observe
lower water quality and higher diarrheal disease rates relative to 
control households. These negative
impacts can perhaps be explained by a combination of non-exclusive use 
of clean CWS water and
reduced self-protection against water quality risks: we find evidence 
that households accessing the CWS
increase the number of water sources on which they rely even as they 
reduce self-protection using in-house water treatment methods. In the 
longer term, as the CWS model spreads throughout the region,
we observe that most of the differences between households in treated 
and control communities fade
away. These findings suggest that caution and additional scrutiny is 
warranted before concluding that
such systems provide safer water to households in communities facing 
drinking water quality problems.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14388_abstract">Residential
 access to modern energy and lighting is important for development in 
that can improve living standards and productivity. However, developing 
countries often face severe constraints on available electricity, which 
result in blackouts. In the developing world, where lighting is a major 
component of residential electricity consumption, energy efficient 
technologies, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), can reduce 
overall household electricity demand while permitting utilities to reach
 additional customers with existing supplies. Through a two-stage 
randomized study of 1,000 households in Kyrgyzstan, we measure the 
impacts of CFLs on household electricity use and whether that response 
differs between households that paid or received the CFLs for free, 
spillovers in take-up and learning about the technology, and the 
aggregate impact of energy efficiency on transformer-level outages. In 
the fall and spring months, the energy efficient light bulbs have a 
significant impact on electricity use, a reduction close to those 
predicted by engineering calculations. The actual and predicted impacts 
of the CFLs, however, significantly diverge during the winter heating 
months, a time when some households use electricity for heating. The 
magnitude of this difference is comparable to the waste heat lost due to
 switching from incandescent bulbs to CFLs, suggesting households 
benefit from the heating services provided by the light bulbs. The 
response to CFLs does not differ between those that received bulbs for 
free versus for a positive price. The spatial variation caused by the 
two-stage randomization indicates significant peer effects in the 
take-up of and preference towards CFLs. Finally, more intense 
distribution of CFLs within a transformer is associated with fewer 
transformer-level electricity outages per month, a statistically and 
technologically significant result. Taken together, these results have 
important policy implications for considering local climate and spatial 
distribution in targeting energy efficient lighting programs.</div>

 and incumbent firms can create new products and displace other firms’

Census data on manufacturing firms from 1963 through 2002, we arrive at 
three main conclusions: First, most growth has seemed to come from 
incumbents’ innovation rather than innovation by entrants. We infer this
 from the modest market share of entering firms. Second, most growth 
seems to have come from improvements of existing varieties rather than 
creation of brand new varieties. We infer this because firm exit rates 
fall only gradually as firms expand, suggesting they are not 
accumulating a larger set of products. Third, own-product improvements 
by incumbents appear to have been more important than creative

increase in the Northern nominal interest will raise the rate of 
Northern innovation and the extent of FDI while reducing the rate of 
Southern imitation and the North-South wage gap. Regarding the effects 
of the Southern monetary policy, the object that is 
liquidity-constrained plays a significant role. If adaptive (imitative) 
R&amp;D is subject to the CIA constraint, then an increase in the 
Southern nominal interest rate will raise (reduce) the rate of Northern 
innovation and the extent of FDI while reducing (raising) the rate of 
Southern imitation. We also examine the responses of social welfare for 
Northern and Southern consumers to monetary policy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14220_abstract">This
 study provides a dynamic macroeconomic model with the features of the 
institutions of China to study the contribution of rural-urban 
migration, especially worked-based migration, to the economic 
development in China. It is a consensus that cheap labor from rural 
areas has contributed to the industrialization and modernization of 
China after the reform in 1979. Different from the reduced-form approach
 adopted by most of the existing literature, we develop a model of 
heterogeneous agents with endogenous fertility and migration decision. 
More specifically, the land entitlement of rural households, the 
differential fertility control policies across urban and rural areas, 
and rural-urban household registration status are introduced into the 
model. This study therefore provides a micro-funded macroeconomic model 
to examine rural households. migration decisions and their relationship 
with land tenure arrangements, urban job opportunities and the 
regulations of the household registration system. Calibration analysis 
of the model is performed, and numerical analysis examining the 
significances of the pull” and retain” factors of migration and their 
effects on output levels is performed. Finally, policy experiments on 
the land entitlement system, migration regulations as well as fertility 
policies are provided.</div>

 choice reforms, such as lottery and voucher programs, give talented 
students the choice to sort out of low-performing schools but often 
leave disadvantaged students behind. This study shows how a Chinese city
 was successful in helping its low-performing schools to catch up by 
encouraging talented students to sort into its low-performing schools. 
The city’s education bureau identified several low-performing middle 
schools and guaranteed elite high school admission to their top 
ten-percent graduates. This paper documents that schools affected by 
this top-ten percent policy improved their performance by 0.3 standard 
deviation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, the city’s lottery 
system for middle school assignment is used to test for changes in 
composition and value-added. Conditional logit regressions show that 
sixth graders with high math scores and high socioeconomic status were 
more likely to choose a low-performing policy school after the policy 
introduction. Instrumental quantile treatment effect estimates show that
 the value-added gaps between policy schools and over-subscribed schools
 were closed for students at both higher and lower quantiles. The study 
suggests that incentives for better students to attend lower-performing 
schools help narrow not only the school performance gap but also the 
school quality gap.</div>

 conduct a large scale RCT to investigate peer effects in computer 
assisted learning (CAL). Identification of peer effects relies on three 
levels of randomization. It is already known that CAL improves math test
 scores in Chinese rural schools. We find that paired treatment improves
 the beneficial effects of treatment for poor performers when they are 
paired with high performers. We test whether CAL treatment reduces the 
dispersion in math scores relative to controls, and we find 
statistically significant evidence that it does. We also demonstrate 
that the beneficial effects of CAL could potentially be strengthened, 
both in terms of average effect and in terms of reduced dispersion, if 
weak students are systematically paired with strong students during 
treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a school

 importance of non-cognitive skills in shaping long-term human capital 
and labor market outcomes is widely acknowledged, but relatively little 
is known about how non-cognitive skills may shape investments by parents
 early in life.  This paper evaluates the parental response to variation
 in non-cognitive skills among their children in rural Gansu province, 
China, using a household fixed effects strategy.  The results suggest 
that on average, parents invest no more in children who have better 
non-cognitive skills relative to their siblings.  However, there is 
significant heterogeneity with respect to maternal education; less 
educated mothers appear to reinforce differences in non-cognitive skills
 between their children, while more educated mothers appear to 
compensate for these differences.  The evidence is consistent with this 
pattern reflecting greater bargaining power for more educated mothers, 
and a greater preference for intrahousehold equity in outcomes among 
children by mothers compared to fathers.  In addition, there is evidence
 that these compensatory investments lead to less persistence over time 
in non-cognitive skills for children of more educated mothers.</div>

 putative links between low interest rates and asset price bubbles was 
not part of the original Taylor rule analysis and not a big part of 
macroeconomic thinking in the early 1990s.  And today, it is a matter of
 considerable controversy whether low nominal interest rate policy is 
necessary or sufficient to produce an asset price boom.  I propose in 
this paper to explore additional empirical data relevant to this ongoing
 debate, by examining the applicability of a Taylor rule to US 
macroeconomic history in the 1920s, a decade which from 1922 onwards 
experienced almost no goods and services price inflation, but a sequence
 of asset booms: in residential construction, non-residential 
construction, and finally, in the second half of the decade, equities.</div>

 paper revisits the "domestic" side of the Barings Crisis of 1890, which
 has received almost no attention in contrast to the international 
dimensions of the crisis.   The sparse existing literature is reviewed 
and new archival evidence constructs a more complete history of how the 
Bank of England managed the crisis.  Although the Barings Crisis is 
often treated as a minor British event compared to the panics of 
1825-1826 and 2007 (Turner, 2013) and even Overend-Gurney, it is 
considered here as a key event, perhaps a turning point, in the conduct 
of central banking.   Whereas, those crises are renowned because of 
their magnitude, they were crisis where the authorities lost control of 
events---policy was reactive.   In contrast, the prompt intervention by 
the Bank and the Treasury in 1890 halted what many believed would have 
been a more severe crisis than occurred in 1866.  The model for this 
discretionary intervention was almost certainly the intervention by the 
Banque de France the year before to halt a run on the second largest 
commercial bank in Paris, the Comptoir d'Escompte (Hautcoeur, Riva and 
White, 2014).   Providing a loan against all the assets---both good and 
bad---of the Comptoir, all depositors and creditors were made whole.  
Any losses were to be absorbed by a guarantee syndicate of banks whose 
composition was in large part determined by their participation in the 
scheme to corner the copper market that ruined the Comptoir.   The 
directors and the officers of the bank paid a heavy price for permitting
 the bank to be undermined by the copper scheme, thus mitigating moral 
hazard.</div>

 outline how an analytical narrative can help to explain the series of 
calamities from the first through the second world wars and why people 
were unable to gain control of economic, social and political 
environments.  What troubled people at the time was that they could not 
explain why these wars, panics, and depressions followed in such quick 
succession after a century of relative calmness and stability.  A 
veritable army of researchers has not turned up many answers.  No one 
has come up with an "explanatio" for the First World War.  My approach 
is to take the outbreak the war in 1914 as an unexplained event that 
touched off war at the start of my narrative.  Given that as the initial
 condition, we can then examine how economic and military factors became
 intertwined with the conduct of the war and the created the problems 
facing world leaders at the end of the war.  While many historians view 
the two decades following the Treaty of Versailles as a lull between two
 huge storms, economic historians view the interwar years as a period of
 intense economic and social turmoil as people struggled to get back 
into some sort of â€œnormalcyâ€ amid the destruction and confusion 
surrounding the end of the war.  Taken together, the two wars and the 
intervening years of depression combine to make a "perfect storm" that 
lasted for forty years.</div>

(2) as search cost diminish, asset prices become efficient in the limit,

 vast empirical literature on investor protection provides much 
convincing evidence on its effects on stock mean-returns, return 
volatilities and interest rates.  In this paper, we develop a dynamic 
asset pricing model of investor protection which sheds light on the 
empirical regularities and uncovers the possible underlying economic 
mechanisms at play.  Our model features a firm owned by a minority 
shareholder and a controlling shareholder who can divert a fraction of 
the firm’s output. The diverted fraction is constrained by investor 
protection and also imposes non-pecuniary costs to the controlling 
shareholder.  Our findings provide support for the empirical evidence on
 asset prices and are as follows. We find that the controlling 
shareholder's stock holding is larger with poor investor protection than
 that with full protection. We demonstrate that the stock mean-return 
decreases with poor investor protection in equilibrium.  We also show 
that the equilibrium stock return volatility is higher with imperfect 
protection than that with full protection.  Moreover, we find that 
interest rates decrease with lower protection.  More generally, the 
effects of investor protection tend to be stronger when the controlling 
shareholder has a low share of the aggregate consumption.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21859_abstract">This
 paper documents how financial institutions alter their firm boundaries 
to overcome credit market frictions and relax financial constraints. 
Specifically, I examine the construction of new grain silos by a large 
agribusiness lender that provides credit to small farmers in Brazil, a 
market characterized by weak legal institutions. I exploit the staggered
 nature of the silo construction and employ a difference-in-differences 
research design to examine how this change in organizational design 
affects lending. I find that ownership of a silo allows the lender to 
significantly increase lending to both existing and new borrowers, with 
the effects being more pronounced for financially constrained borrowers 
and those exposed to more weather risk. Furthermore, it enables the 
lender to offer a new contract that provides a price hedge, an 
innovation that is particularly useful for periods with high commodity 
price volatility. Most importantly, the effects are stronger in 
municipalities with weak courts, by so emphasizing the contract 
enforcement channel. Thus, the paper uncovers an alternative enforcement
 mechanism, designed by the lender, to overcome weak creditor rights.</div>

 study network-formation models with local network externalities, 
allowing a dyad's incentives for link formation to depend on any 
connections involving the ego or alter. We develop asymptotic theory 
under the assumption that the econometrician observes a single large 
pairwise-stable network, formalizing the idea that when externalities 
are local, certain subnetworks are conditionally independent. This 
result is used to derive an unconditional weak law of large numbers for a
 useful class of network moments. We show that under the conditions that
 guarantee a weak law, the model generates sparse networks that may 
percolate (contain "giant" connected subnetworks), properties consistent
 with those of real-world social networks.  The conditions also 
conveniently suggest a new method to simulate counterfactual networks 
that avoids a well-known curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we study
 the empirical content of the model by characterizing the identified set
 based on a tractable class of pair-level network moments.  We construct
 estimators for these moments by applying our weak law.

 of the relevant linkages between individuals is usually necessary for 
the estimation of social interaction models.  We obtain results that 
allow for the estimation of parameters of interest in such models

 in, e.g., Bramoulle, Djebbari and Fortin (Journal of Econometrics,

 paper provides estimation methods for network formation models using 
observed data of a single large network. We characterize network 
formation as a simultaneous-move game with incomplete information and 
allow for the effects of indirect friends such as friends in common, so 
the utility from direct friends can be nonseparable. Nonseparability 
poses an challenge in the estimation because each individual then faces 
an interdependent multinomial discrete choice problem where the choice 
set increases with the number of individuals n. We propose a novel 
method to linearize the utility and derive the closed form of the 
conditional choice probability (CCP). With the closed form CCP, we show 
that the finite-player game converges to some limiting game as n goes to
 infinity. We propose a two-step estimation procedure using the 
equilibrium condition from the limiting game. The estimation procedure 
makes little assumption on equilibrium selection, is computationally 
simple, and provides consistent and asymptotic normal estimators for the
 structural parameters. Monte Carlo simulations show that the limiting 
game approximates finite-player games well and can provide accurate 
estimates.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21754_abstract">Models
 where utility depends on the difference between the consumed quantity 
vector and a vector of perceived minimum "needs" go back to Samuelson 
(1947). We model peer effects by letting the average consumption of 
one's peers affect the quantity vector that defines one's perceived 
needs. We show how dollar costs of these peer effects on welfare can be 
obtained in these models. In addition to the usual obstacles to 
identification in peer effects models, here only a small number of 
members of each peer group are observed, so true mean group consumption 
levels cannot be consistently estimated. We propose and apply a new 
identification and estimation strategy for spatial or social 
interactions data to deal with the resulting identification problems. We
 implement our model with Indian household-level consumption microdata. 
We find that peer effects are important for luxuries and not 
necessities. Our estimates imply that, in terms of utility, the cost of 
"keeping up with the Joneses" effects equaled about about 15% of total 
Indian GDP growth from 1994 to 2010. Samuelson (1947) and Gorman (1976) 
propose models where an individual's perceived "needs" are represented 
by a quantity vector of goods. People get utility from the difference 
between the quantity vector they actually consume and this quantity 
vector of needs. We model peer effects in consumption choices (e.g., 
"keeping up with the Joneses") by letting the average consumption of 
one's peers affect the quantity vector that defines one's perceived 
needs. The resulting model is an example of a social interactions or 
spatial regression framework, where the quantity one consumes of goods, 
particularly luxuries, depends not only on one's own budget and other 
characteristics, but also on the average consumption of luxuries and/or 
other goods consumed by one's peers.</div>

 theoretical advances, measurement issues have impeded empirical 
research on aspirations. We quantify political aspirations in a 
developing country by estimating individuals’ willingness to trade-off 
family size for political candidacy. Utilizing quasi-experimental 
variation in legal fertility limits on village council members in India,
 we find that at least 2.21% of married couples of childbearing age 
altered their fertility to remain eligible for council membership. This 
implies that returns to local leadership in low-income democracies are 
potentially high. Poorer, less educated, and lower-caste families 
display strong political aspirations, thereby lowering the extent of

 paper provides novel evidence on a particular real cost of political 
interference on banks — preferential lending to politically important 
sectors crowds out lending to other sectors in the economy. Analyzing 
staggered state elections in India, I show that politicians influence 
banks to increase lending to farmers before elections, which crowds out 
lending to manufacturing firms. These lending distortions are larger in 
locations where farmers have more political weight. Comparing firms in 
states that have an election in a given year against comparable firms in
 states that do not, I find that the reduced availability of bank credit
 forces firms to use up their cash reserves, reduce production, lay off 
workers, and operate at lower utilization rates. Overall, my results 
suggest that interference from the political environment can lead to 
costly crowding-out of real firm activity.</div>

 is well known that new businesses are typically much smaller than their
 established industry competitors, and that this size gap closes slowly.
 We show that even in commodity-like product markets, these patterns do 
not reflect productivity gaps, but rather differences in demand-side 
fundamentals. We document and explore patterns in plants’ idiosyncratic 
demand levels by estimating a dynamic model of plant expansion in the 
presence of a demand accumulation process (e.g., building a customer 
base). We find active accumulation driven by plants’ past production 
decisions quantitatively dominates passive demand accumulation, and that
 within-firm spillovers affect demand levels but not growth. This demand
 accumulation process has important implications for ongoing research in
 fields as diverse as industrial organization, macro, finance, and 
trade.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21719_abstract">The
 United States has experienced a secular decline in entrepreneurial 
activity, a decline that intensified during the Great Recession. Younger
 and smaller businesses were hit especially hard in the Great Recession,
 and have been slow to recover. Credit conditions are a potentially 
important factor in this development.  Recent evidence shows, for 
example, that states with the largest declines in housing prices also 
experienced the largest declines in activity by young and small 
businesses. We build on this work and investigate several mechanisms and
 channels whereby credit market conditions affect entrepreneurial 
activity. Home equity and consumer credit may be quite important for 
some industries and business types, whereas lending collateralized by 
business assets might matter for others.  Household balance sheets may 
matter acutely for the youngest firms (i.e., at the point of startup). 
Financing from banks is likely important for other types of firms and 
perhaps later in the life cycle of young firms. Venture capital is an 
important source of finance for a small fraction of young firms with 
high growth potential.  We also explore a related but distinct channel 
whereby uncertainty in financial markets contributed to the adverse 
outcomes for young and small businesses.  We investigate the role of 
these financial market factors for young and small businesses by 
exploiting variation across industries and locations.  We integrate data
 from several sources.  For tracking entrepreneurial activity, we rely 
on data from the Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS) and the Quarterly 
Workforce Indicators (QWI).  For credit market conditions, we use data 
on small business loans, home prices and home equity, and consumer debt.
 We also construct measures that capture the impact of uncertainty 
shocks on firm-level credit spreads that vary by broad groups such as 
industry, firm size and firm age.</div>

 pay firms have notably lower declines in employment over the business 
cycle, but more volatile wages. Such a finding suggests that the firm 
behaves as a vehicle for partial insurance among workers. We deal with 
endogeneity by instrumenting performance pay with measures of 
state-level labor wedges, which depress raise firms’ costs of monitoring

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21721_abstract">Who
 fares worse in an economic downturn, low- or high-paying firms? 
Different answers to this question imply very different consequences for
 the costs of recessions. Using U.S. employer-employee data, we find 
that employment growth at low-paying firms is less cyclically sensitive.
 High-paying firms grow more quickly in booms and shrink more quickly in
 busts. We show that this is accounted for by a greater reduction in 
separations from low-paying firms in busts, and especially from 
separations that are likely voluntary. This suggests that a partial 
collapse of the job ladder (upward progression toward higher paying 
firms) during downturns is the most likely driver of our results. We 
estimate that workers at the lowest paying firms are 20% less likely to 
advance in firm quality in a bust compared to a boom. We also find that 
workers matching to firms in a downturn achieve only half the 
advancement in firm quality that a worker matching in a boom experiences
 within the first year. Thus job composition can potentially account for
 some of the lasting negative impacts on workers forced to search for a 
job in a downturn, such as displaced workers and recent college 
graduates.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14044_abstract">Intermediation is a prominent feature of economic production and exchange. &lt;br /&gt;
Two features of intermediation are salient: coordination among traders &lt;br /&gt;
between the `source' and the `destination' and competition between &lt;br /&gt;
alternative combinations of intermediaries. We develop a simple model to &lt;br /&gt;
study these forces and we test the theoretical predictions in experiments. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our theoretical analysis yields a complete characterization of pricing &lt;br /&gt;
equilibrium in networks. There exist both efficient and inefficient &lt;br /&gt;
equilibria, suggesting a key role of coordination among intermediaries. &lt;br /&gt;
Strategic interaction leads to either buyer and seller retaining all surplus &lt;br /&gt;
or intermediaries extracting all surplus. We develop conditions on network &lt;br /&gt;
structure under which these different extremal outcomes arise, respectively. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laboratory experiments show that efficiency prevails in almost all cases: so &lt;br /&gt;
traders are successful in coordination. Subjects coordinate on extreme &lt;br /&gt;
surplus division. Finally, experiments highlight the role of network &lt;br /&gt;
structure in determining division of surplus between traders&lt;br /&gt;</div>

 randomly invite households in rural Indian villages to participate in a
 study in which they can earn roughly a day's wages, and study how 
information about that opportunity diffuses. In particular, we examine 
strategic information diffusion.    Slots in the study are limited and 
rationed among those who show up, information about the opportunity is 
something that individuals may wish to share with their friends, but 
would prefer not to have spread beyond their friends.  We find that 
people are significantly more likely to tell their less central friends 
about the opportunity than their more central friends, controlling for 
other characteristics.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13775_abstract">This
 paper conjectures that economics has changed profoundly since the 1970s
 and that these changes involve a new understanding of the relationship 
between theoretical and applied work: as the discipline became more 
applied, applied work was being accorded a higher status in relation to 
pure theory than was previously the case. This change is visible in John
 Bates Clark medal citations as well as in the debates surrounding the 
elimination of the “theory” category from the JEL classification for 
economic literature. Yet, these also suggest tensions in the meaning of 
“applied” research (the application of abstract theory to answer 
specific problems; empirical research; policy work). The paper presents 
various types of applied work, and discusses possible explanations for 
its changing status relative to theory: the rise of “big data” and 
computerization; the displacement of general equilibrium theory by game 
theory or experimental and behavioral economics; the rise of non 
academic institutions such as central banks, the IMF, the World Bank or 
the NBER; the “challenge of relevance” resulting from the upheavals of 
civil societies.</div>

 historians of economics have noted the transition toward empirical work
 in economics since the 1970s, less understood is the shift toward 
"quasi-experimental" methods in applied microeconomics. Angrist and 
Pischke (2010) trumpet the wide application of these methods as a 
"credibility revolution" in econometrics that has finally provided 
persuasive answers to a diverse set of questions. Particularly 
influential in the applied areas of labor, education, public, and health
 economics, the methods shape the knowledge produced by economists and 
the expertise they possess. First documenting their growth 
bibliometrically, this paper aims to illuminate the origins, content, 
and contexts of quasi-experimental research designs, which seek natural 
experiments to justify causal inference. To highlight lines of 
continuity and discontinuity in the transition, the quasi-experimental 
program is situated in the historical context of the Cowles econometric 
framework and a case study from the economics of education is used to 
contrast the practical implementation of the approaches. Finally, 
significant historical contexts of the paradigm shift are explored, 
including the marketability of quasi-experimental methods and the 1980s 
crisis in econometrics.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13777_abstract">This
 paper analyzes several early applied experimental economics projects 
Charles Plott, Vernon Smith and their associates conducted at the 
California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and University of Arizona 
in the 1970s and 1980s. These projects ranged from the allocation of 
airport landing slots for the Civil Aeronautics Board in the wake of US 
airlines deregulation and the regulation of the dry bulk commodity 
transportation industry on inland waterways for the Department of 
Transportation, to the anti-trust case against the producers of 
lead-based antiknock compounds, the regulation of pricing of natural gas
 transmission, electric power networks and their deregulation, 
allocation of the right to use railway tracks and the allocation of 
resources on a space station. This partial list demonstrates the breadth
 of regulatory problems to which experimental methods were applied as 
well as suggests the importance of such projects to the early 
experimentalists. In particular I focus on the case of the allocation of
 airport landing slots to tackle two related historiographic issues – 
the operationalization of applied research through experimentation and 
the reception of applied experimental research by the wider economics 
profession.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13778_abstract">Environmentalism
 in the United States historically has been divided into its utilitarian
 and preservationist impulses, represented by Gifford Pinchot and John 
Muir, respectively.  Pinchot advocated conservation of natural resources
 to be used for human purposes; Muir advocated protection from humans, 
for nature's own sake.  Environmental economics was, not surprisingly, 
for many years firmly in Pinchot's side of that schism.  That position 
began to change in the 1960s, as it increasingly became harder to defend
 the idea that all resources should be turned to consumptive or other 
material uses.  In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources 
for the Future, pushed economics to the point that it could embrace 
Muir's vision as well as Pinchot's.  Consider a river that might be 
dammed for hydroelectric power or preserved it in its natural state.  
Krutilla argued that if humans preferred the natural state to the 
electric power, than such preferences were every bit as "economic" as 
the opposite preference.  Either way, there were opportunity costs and 
an economic choice to be made.  Krutilla pushed the economics profession
 to price these foregone opportunities into its social decisions.</div>

 data from British and American banks, we provide empirical evidence 
that government intervention affects banking globalization along three 
dimensions: depth, breadth and persistence.  We examine depth by 
studying whether a bank’s preference for domestic, as opposed to 
external, lending (funding) changes when it is subjected to a large 
public intervention, such as bank nationalization.  Our results suggest 
that, following nationalization, non-British banks allocate their 
lending away from the UK and increase their external funding.  Second, 
we find that nationalized banks from the same country tend to have 
portfolios of foreign assets that are spread across countries in a way 
that is far more similar than either private banks from the same country
 or nationalized banks from different countries, consistent with an 
impact on the breadth of globalization.  Third, we study the Troubled 
Asset Relief Program (TARP) to examine the persistence of large 
government interventions.  We find weak evidence that upon entry into 
the TARP, foreign lending declines but domestic does not.  This effect 
is observable at the aggregate level, and seems to disappear upon TARP 
exit.  Collectively, this evidence suggests that large government 
interventions affect the depth and breadth of banking globalization, but
 may not persist after public interventions are unwound.</div>

rates for key country-specific fundamentals - productivity, the quality of export goods,
net foreign assets, and output gaps - generates a more refined measure of currency value
that is more closely linked to currency risk premia. Accounting for macroeconomic

 identify a set of country macroeconomic fundamentals, whose first and 
higher-order moments have predictive power for currency excess returns. 
We use this identification to form ‘high minus low’ portfolios of 
profitable currency excess returns and then study the determinants of 
their cross- sectional behavior. This analysis makes three points. 
First, to understand the cross-section of these currency excess returns 
with macroeconomic risk factors requires a multi-factor model. Second, 
since the excess returns are not exclusive to investors with a U.S. 
domicile, the macro risk factors are global in nature. Third, the risk 
factors priced into the excess returns include the volatility of the 
global macro variables. When global uncertainty increases, weak 
currencies fall and strong or safe haven currencies rise so shorting the
 weak and going long the strong results in large excess returns.</div>

 crisis in the Eurozone has been the greatest failure in the history of 
European integration. Trillions of dollars in accumulated debts have 
confronted the member states with a difficult set of inter-state and 
domestic problems, largely to do with the distribution of the burden of 
economic adjustment in the light of a decade of ill-advised lending and 
borrowing. To the discredit of both national governments and European 
institutions, conflict has dragged on for years – and still continues – 
with no real resolution. Possible Pareto improvements have fallen by the
 wayside as countries maneuver to shunt as much of the adjustment burden
 as possible onto their partners, and as groups within countries do the 
same domestically.</div>

 then speaking of the Eurozone crisis, the paper suggests speaking of

different route then crises inside the Eurozone. Also, not all member 
states of the Eurozone were in the same ways entangled with the fall

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14058_abstract">In
 2004 ten new European Union member states were added to the existing EU
 of fifteen. All ten were required by their accession treaty to join the
 euro at some point. Various member states joined sooner for example 
Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta. Others, such as the Baltic States were keen 
to join sooner but were disallowed because the European Commission found
 them not meeting the criteria. The largest three member states first 
were keen to join fast but their interest diminished as time went by. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This paper presents an analysis of euro adoption policies in these ten 
member states. It builds on research done by Dandashly and Verdun 
(forthcoming) that studies various different theoretical insights into 
understanding the results. The analysis looks at: cost benefit analysis;
 meeting the convergence criteria; political economy insights (exchange 
rates, trade, openness) and domestic political veto players, the stance 
of government and opposition and the role of the central bank. This 
paper compares competing explanations of the speed of euro adoption and 
suggests that a domestic politics approach is best able to explain why 
some countries join the euro fast whilst others are much slower.</div>

their influence in the Council of the European Union. We compare the 
simulation results to observed outcomes of the legislative process and

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14061_abstract">The
 2008 crisis started as a financial crisis and evolved into a sovereign 
debt crisis. Since 2008, central banks, governments and international 
organizations have been working on the lessons learned as well as 
designing options for a new financial framework. From the Dodd-Frank Act
 in the United States to Basel III, the international financial world 
has seen relevant changes. In Europe, the 'Banking Union' was passed. In
 itself, it is already an interesting reform. But beyond the primary 
objective of the Banking Union, which is to ensure financial stability, 
there is also a second feature: it deepens the European integration 
providing a response to the critics of the European project. Now 
equipped with an internal market of goods, services, including financial
 services, the question is to know whether the EU has fixed its 
structural issues in terms of governance. If a new crisis were to hit 
Europe, would the latter be better prepared to respond? Another question
 is to know whether this new framework would reduce the systemic risk 
and thus would reduce either the likelihood or the magnitude of a 
crisis?</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14166_abstract">In 2009, the Japanese government mandated a short hour option for workers with children
under the age of three who were employed at firms with at least 101 workers. In addition, by
2005, firms with at least 301 workers were required to register plans to improve work-family
balance. This paper provides a causal analysis of the effects of both mandates on childbirth
and parental leave-taking, using data from the 2002-2011 waves of the Panel Survey of
Young Adults of 21st Century collected by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. I exploit
exogenous variation in the mandate laws. Using difference-in-difference methods, I find
the both policies increased strong birth inten among working females with no children.
We also found robust evidence that the shor ur option increased the first, second and
third birth of working mothers with high birth intention. The effect was strong for the highly
educated. Mandating work flexibility significantly reduced the cost of childbirth, increased
birth intention and birth among working mothers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14168_abstract">To motivate fathers to take parental leave, several nations have reformed their leave
programs to increase compensation and reserve some leave for fathers. Though take-up has
increased, it is unclear whether fathers are responding to financial incentives or changed
constraints or the 'daddy-only' labels. Moreover, although paternity leave may facilitate
temporary changes in the division of household labor, little is known about whether these
effects persist in later years. This paper examines these issues while studying the Quebec
Parental Insurance Program (QPIP), a landmark reform to parental leave that increased
benefits for all parents and reserved some weeks for fathers. I exploit plausibly exogenous
program variation and data on benefit claims to first explore the short-run effects on leave
behavior. Both regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analyses suggest that
QPIP increased fathers' participation rates b 0% and leave duration by 150%. Further, I
find novel evidence of an intra-household fly er effect stemming from the 'daddy-only'
label: benefits stick to fathers even when the constraint does not bind and the 'daddyonly'
benefits are essentially fungible with the mothers'. Next, I investigate the long-term
consequences on household dynamics by analyzing time-diary data and exploiting variation
in exposure to QPIP across provinces, time and the age of one's children. This paper
presents the first comprehensive evidence that exposure to paternity leave can have a large
and persistent effect on the division of household labor: households exposed to QPIP are
markedly less sex specialized in their time allocations, earnings and labor supply.</div>

This paper investigates the effects of a large-scale paid maternity leave program on birth
outcomes in the United States. In 1978, states with Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI)
programs were required to start providing wage replacement benefits to pregnant women,
substantially increasing access to paid leave for working mothers. Using natality data, I find
that TDI coverage of paid maternity leave reduces the share of low birth weight births in a
state by 3.2 percent, and the estimated treatment-on-the-treated effect is over 10 percent.
TDI paid maternity leave also decreases the likelihood of early term birth by 7.2 percent.
Paid maternity leave has particularly large impacts on the children of unmarried and black
mothers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14150_abstract">The new generation of city minimum wage policies poses unique challenges for
researchers attempting to assess their economic impacts. Traditional datasets often do
not have sufficient samples sizes. City-based wage setting means that regional economic
models are needed to assess net economic impact. Most important, recent city laws adopt
significantly higher percentage increases in the minimum wage than have been implemented
to date in the US. This means that researchers have less empirical research evidence
on which to base their modeling. It also means that new substantive questions arise; for
example, the impact on nonprofit organizations that rely mainly on fixed public funding
streams. We discuss these and other challenges based on our recent prospective impact
studies of four California cities.</div>

 efficiency is the productivity of the process for matching jobseekers 
to available jobs. Job-finding is the output; vacant jobs and active 
jobseekers are the inputs. Measurement of matching efficiency follows 
the same principles as measuring a Hicks-neutral index of productivity 
of production. We develop a framework for measuring matching 
productivity when the population of jobseekers is heterogeneous. The 
efficiency index for each type of jobseeker is the monthly job-finding 
rate for the type adjusted for the overall tightness of the labor 
market. We find that overall matching efficiency declined over the 
period, at just below its earlier downward trend. We develop a new 
approach to measuring matching rates that avoids counting short-duration
 jobs as successes. And we show that the outward shift in the Beveridge 
curve in the post-crisis period is the result of pre-crisis trends, not a
 downward shift in matching efficiency attributable to the crisis.</div>

 develop a simple dynamic model of a worker's transitions between 
employment and non-employment. Our model implies that a worker finds a 
job at an optimal stopping time, when a Brownian motion with drift hits a
 barrier. The model has structural duration dependence in the job 
finding rate, in the sense that the hazard rate of finding a job changes
 during a non-employment spell for a given worker. In addition, we allow
 for arbitrary parameter heterogeneity across workers, so dynamic 
selection also affects the average job finding rate at different 
durations. We show that our model has testable implications if we 
observe at least two completed non-employment spells for each worker. 
Moreover, we can identify the distribution of a subset of our model's 
parameters using data on the duration of repeated non-employment spells 
and use the estimated parameters to understand the determinants of 
duration dependence. We use a large panel of social security data for 
Austrian workers to test and estimate the model. Our model is not 
rejected by the data. Our parameter estimates indicate that dynamic 
selection is critical for understanding the evolution of the aggregate 
job finding rate.  For example, while the aggregate job finding hazard 
rate falls from 5.2 percent to 2.2 percent per week during the second 
and third quarter of a non-employment spell, this entirely reflects 
changes in the distribution of jobless workers.  For the average worker,
 the weekly job finding hazard rate actually rises by 3.7 percentage 
points during this same period.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13727_abstract">This paper examines the circumstances under which majority rule decision-making will
support, rather than impede, wealth creation. We develop a model – inspired by Aristotle and
Lindahl – in which voting on whether to provide a public good can work well or badly, depending
on whether voters share the public good’s costs and benefits in a manner close to or far from the
Lindahl prescription. Under some conditions, it is feasible to design political institutions that
complement the exogenous features of the economy (specifically, the opportunities for wealth
creation) to align incentives in a Lindahl-like manner, so that when citizens vote on the basis of what
they stand individually to gain or lose from a policy decision, they will vote as if they are seeking
to maximize net social benefits. Yet under other (i.e., non-ideal) conditions, the design of good
institutions may require facing tradeoffs among three objectives: the maintenance of the majority’s
support for wealth-enhancing policies; gains from specialization and trade; and keeping policy
decisions responsive to the majority’s preferences. We use the model to guide our analysis of how
two pioneers of majority-rule systems – Athens and Sparta – designed (and redesigned) their
institutions in response to changes in their opportunities for wealth creation. We also discuss lessons
for the modern world, notably growing polarization in American politics.</div>

 international guidelines, official statistics on international trade 
and investment include transactions within multinational enterprises 
(MNEs) and positions on foreign direct investment.  A complicating 
factor in the interpretation and understanding of the official 
statistics is the role of transactions and positions for MNEs structured
 with one or more special purpose entities (SPEs).  In contrast to 
operating entities (OEs), SPEs generally have few or no employees, 
little or no physical presence, and little or no production or economic 
activity.  While recent research explores the effects of SPEs on some 
U.S. macroeconomic statistics, very little is known from a microeconomic
 perspective about the underlying characteristics of SPEs.  This paper 
provides an empirical look at non-resident SPEs whose transactions are 
included in official statistics on U.S. direct investment abroad.  In 
particular, the paper treats OE affiliates as a benchmark group in a 
univariate and a multivariate analysis of characteristics available in 
survey data.  The results reveal a large number of non-resident SPEs 
sponsored by U.S. MNEs, which are not isolated to a few industries or a 
single global region.  Significant differences exist between SPE 
affiliates and OE affiliates in their balance sheet components, income 
statement components, and measured production.  Given the fact pattern 
demonstrated in the microdata, measured production attributed to SPE 
affiliates appears to be incongruent with reported economic activity.</div>

 ongoing debate in employment policy is whether promoting small and 
medium enterprises creates more employment.  Do small enterprises 
generate more employment growth than larger enterprises? We use the 
elimination of small-scale industry (SSI) promotion in India to address 
this question. For 60 years, SSI promotion in India focused on reserving
 certain products for manufacture by small and medium enterprises. We 
identify the consequences for employment growth, investment, output, 
productivity, and wages of dismantling India’s SSI reservations. We 
exploit variation in the timing of de-reservation across products and 
also measure the long-run impact of national SSI policy changes using 
variation in pre-treatment exposure at the district level. Districts 
more exposed to de-reservation experienced higher employment and output 
growth. Growth was driven by entrants into de-reserved products and by 
incumbents previously constrained by size restrictions. The results 
suggest that promoting small and medium enterprises through India’s SSI 
policies did not encourage overall employment growth. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14517_abstract">The
 degree of offshoring in high-tech industries has increased rapidly in 
past decades. Because of this trend, economists have been debating 
whether offshoring is hollowing out U.S. high-tech firms’ core 
competencies in intangibles. To shed light on this question, I first 
applied the forward-looking model developed by Li (2012) to the 
Compustat dataset to measure the capital stock and depreciation rate of 
R&amp;D and organizational capital for major U.S. R&amp;D-intensive 
industries during the period of 1995 to 2011. Then, I used the world 
input-output database to calculate the annual value added per export 
ratio, a measure of an industry’s degree of international production 
fragmentation, for each major high-tech industry. Lastly, I used those 
estimates to analyze whether industries with a higher degree of 
offshoring exhibited a different investment pattern in intangibles. The 
results show that industries with a lower degree of offshore outsourcing
 are more competitive in the global market and have R&amp;D assets and 
organizational capital that are complementary. In contrast, industries 
with a higher degree of offshore outsourcing invest less in both R&amp;D
 and organizational capital, but have higher R&amp;D depreciation rates.
 An interesting and significant finding of this research is that the 
R&amp;D depreciation rate can serve as a new technology indicator, 
showing the industry’s international ranking that is consistent with 
Forbes’ global 2000 ranking.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14518_abstract">A
 number of authors have argued that a worker's occupation of employment 
is at least as important as the worker's industry of employment in 
determining whether the worker will be hurt or helped by international 
trade.  We investigate the role of occupational mobility on the effects 
of trade shocks on wage inequality in a dynamic, structural econometric 
model of worker adjustment. Each worker in our specification can switch 
either industry, occupation, or both, paying a time-varying cost to do 
so in a rational-expectations optimizing environment. We also specify a 
novel model of offshoring based on task-by-task comparative advantage 
that collapses to a very simple form for simulation. We find that the 
costs of switching industry and occupation are both high, and of similar
 magnitude. In simulations we find that a worker's industry of 
employment is much more important than either the worker's occupation or
 skill class in determining whether or not she is harmed by a trade 
shock, but occupation is crucial in determining who is harmed by an 
offshoring shock.</div>

 study compares cost and productivity changes of full-service carriers

regional or charter firms.  Findings show cost reductions of 10 percent 
for FSCs and 20 percent for regionals/charters, and cost increases of  
8.5 percent for LCCs from 1993 to 2014. Nontrivial productivity gains 
due to increases in load factor and stage length explain the findings

for LCCs, while productivity gains due to increases in load factor and 
stage length and unexplained technical change contribute to cost 
declines for ‘other’ carriers. These findings are interpreted as

 paper presents several important contributions to the port literature. 
First, this paper deduces measures of quality of port services provided

 quality of these services varying, this paper reaches the conclusion 
that the port long-run cargo throughput economic cost function that has 
appeared in the literature is miss-specified. Third, this paper extends 
and generalizes the existing literature by deriving the first port 
multi-service long-run joint economic joint cost function, i.e., a cost 
function for which port resources are shared in the provision of port 
multi-services. Until now, port multi-service and multi-throughput 
long-run economic cost functions that have appeared in the literature 
are non-joint cost functions, assuming that multi-services and 
multi-throughputs do not share port resources, which can oftentimes be a
 restrictive assumption.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13996_abstract">Although
 freight transport contributes significantly to the productivity of the 
U.S. economy, it also involves sizable costs to society. Those costs 
include wear and tear on roads and bridges; delays caused by traffic 
congestion; injuries, fatalities, and property damage from accidents; 
and harmful effects from exhaust emissions. No one pays those external 
costs directly—neither freight haulers, nor shippers, nor consumers. The
 unpriced external costs of transporting freight by truck (per ton-mile)
 are around eight times higher than by rail; those costs net of existing
 taxes represent about 20 percent of the cost of truck transport and 
about 11 percent of the cost of rail transport. 
This study examines policy options to address those unpriced external 
costs. The options would impose taxes based on the weight or distance of
 each shipment, increase the existing tax on diesel fuel, implement a 
tax on the transport of shipping containers, or increase the existing 
tax on truck tires. The analysis estimates what would have occurred in 
2007 had the simulated policies already been in place and had any 
initial, short-term transitions in response to the policies already 
occurred. 
Adding unpriced external costs to the rates charged by each mode of 
transport—via a weight-distance tax plus an increase in the tax on 
diesel fuel—would have caused a 3.6 percent shift of ton-miles from 
truck to rail and a 0.8 percent reduction in the total amount of tonnage
 transported. Such a policy would have eliminated 3.2 million highway 
truck trips per year and saved about 670 million gallons of fuel 
annually (including the increase in fuel used for rail freight). On net,
 accounting for the effect of fuel savings on revenue from the fuel tax,
 such a policy would also have generated about $68 billion per year in 
new tax revenue and reduced external costs by</div>

 evidence on gender discrimination in lending remains controversial. To 
capture gender biases in banks’ loan allocations, we observe the impact

 the change in the MFI’s gender-related attitude was triggered by banks 
through co-financing. This paper stresses that apparently benign

 main interpretations have been put forward of European countries’

 pointing to rising capital flows as a result of both monetary 
unification in Euro-area countries, and legislation liberalising 
cross-border activities of financial firms in the European Union as a 
whole. The second interpretation, emphasising competitiveness 
differentials between core and periphery countries, calls into question 
different wage and price dynamics, with responsibilities shifted back 
and forth between peripheral countries, accused of lax wage and price 
policies, and core countries accused of “mercantilist” practices 
intended to damage other European partners via excessive wage moderation
 and real exchange rate depreciation.  I show these same issues 
motivated economic debates by Neopolitan economists of the seventeenth 
century.we become aware that the interaction of real and financial 
markets responsible for our current macroeconomic imbalances are not a 
recent phenomenon: they existed and determined similar problems in the 
remote times of our economists too. And, through the empirical 
regularities  that they described, we learn about fascinating 
continuities and differences in the structure of financial markets and 
real economies between their times and ours.</div>

for the bulk of the population.This has created a paradox in our

because his massive increases in interest rates threw workers out of 
work, raised profits for banks, and dramatically increased inequality. 
For decades the Fed has been criticized by progressives and heterodox 
economists for keeping interest rates too high, and for padding the 
profits of bankers while making it more difficult for businesses to 
invest, expand and create jobs. But now, the Fed is being accused of 
raising inequality by doing the opposite: by lowering interest rates. 
Can both of these be true? Has the world been turned upside down? What 
can economic analysis tell us about who gains and who loses from the 
Fed’s recent Quantitative Easing (QE)? The answer is yes because of 
important changes in the structure of financial markets and the 
macroeconomy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14428_abstract">The
 re-branding of capital controls during the global crisis reflects the 
increased policy space that many developing countries enjoy. Controls 
also widen the space for other policy innovations, and may protect 
developing economies from the capital outflows and instability 
associated with the end of quantitative easing by the US.  The use of 
capital controls is consistent with Albert Hirschman’s embrace of the 
right of developing nations to engage in policy and institutional 
experimentation; his appreciation of the power asymmetries between 
smaller and larger states, and the consequent need to enhance the 
autonomy of the former vis-à-vis the latter; and his emphasis on the 
unintended effects on democratic governance of the exercise of voice and

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14429_abstract">This
 paper adds specificity to the financialization literature by 
decomposing the rise to power of financial capitalists. Two sources of 
financial power are identified: traditional financial power (TFP) and 
the threat of shareholder activism (TSA). Three different stages of 
development are identified for each source. The TFP stages consider 1) 
intra financial capitalist competition associated with early attempts to
 circumvent segregated functions and markets; 2) intra finance 
capitalist competition that results from the inflation-high interest 
rate - deregulation nexus of the later 70s and 80s; and 3) renewed intra
 finance capitalist competition from a second wave of circumventing 
segregated markets and functions. The TSA phases correspond to the 
hostile takeover period, the rise of institutional investors and hedge 
fund activism. The ebbs and flow of power between commercial banks, 
investment banks and other financial actors associated with these phases
 are addressed through various empirical measures of TFP and TSA. The 
impact of this power trajectory on industrial capitalist is considered 
throughout. Finally, the decomposed measures of financial power are 
incorporated into  TFP and  TSA indices through the use of principal 
components analysis. These indices potentially serve as a basis for 
aggregate analysis of profit rates and investment rates as they relate 
to financial power.</div>

 U.S. exports of primary and bulk agricultural commodities are growing 
slowly (and in some cases declining), processed food exports have 
experienced substantial growth from $37 billion in 1998 to $104 billion 
in 2012, an increase of 178%. Food processing firms vary in sizes, which
 is an important determinant of whether they sell only in the domestic 
market or also export, and engage in monopolistic competition in highly 
differentiated food products. A major market for U.S. processed food 
exports is the European Union-27 (EU), and the EU is the largest 
exporter of processed food to the United States. However, trade in 
processed food still faces substantial tariff and non-tariff barriers. 
To reduce these trade barriers, the United States is actively 
negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) 
with the EU, which will call for phasing out of trade restrictions and 
harmonization of NTBs and enhance market access to value added food 
products. The purpose of this study is to develop a theoretical model 
characterizing the monopolistic competition and firm-level heterogeneity
 to empirically quantify the effects of TTIP on productivity, prices, 
supply, demand, and trade in the food processing industry and estimate 
the welfare implications of this agreement. This study will estimate the
 effects of exports on the growth potential of firms because more 
productive firms will thrive in the export market and inefficient firms 
may exit the industry, which will cause inter-firm reallocation of 
resources within the industry. In addition, trade will also increase the
 total number of firms as more firms from other countries enter into the
 market, which will introduce new brands, varieties, and food items. 
This study will assess the competitive positions of U.S. firms versus 
foreign firms, which will be useful to the food processing industry and 
policy makers and promote economic growth.</div>

 study the role of trade intermediaries in facilitating Chinese 
agricultural exports by reducing sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) 
barriers. Chinese agricultural exporters had anticipated fast growth 
after China joined the WTO in 2001, but growth was relatively slow due 
to SPS barriers to trade. While most of China has had trouble meeting 
international SPS standards, certain coastal and export-oriented regions
 largely have been able to do so. We analyze transaction-level customs 
data for regional differences in agricultural export growth. The data 
also allow us to identify the use of export intermediaries. Moreover, we
 develop a trade model with heterogeneous producers in which 
intermediaries can facilitate agricultural exports for producers that 
lack the economies of scale to overcome SPS barriers to trade.</div>

 modern world, I claim, was made not by the usual material causes, such

rights or even science, but by technical and institutional ideas among a
 revalued bourgeoisie.  In Early Modern times in northwestern Europe a 
novel way of looking at the virtues and at bettering ideas came from 
liberty and dignity for commoners, among them the bourgeoisie.  The 
bourgeoisie did not get better.  And its increasing numbers would have 
been useless without what did in fact occur: a startling revaluation of 
the trading and betterment in which the bourgeoisie specialized.  The 
revaluation was called "liberalism."  Liberalism in turn did not come 
from some ancient superiority of the Europeans but from egalitarian 
accidents in their politics 1517-1789.  The upshot since 1800 has been a
 gigantic improvement of the poor, and a promise now being fulfilled of

 decades that followed the end of World War II are commonly referred to 
as the golden age of economic growth as they were marked by the highest 
growth rates that the world economy has witnessed to this date. This 
temporal sequence raises the natural question of whether and to what 
extent these growth rates were the outcome of a prolonged reconstruction
 process that began after the end of the war. We revisit this important 
question by investigating the impact of the post-war output gap on the 
subsequent growth experiences of different countries in different 
regions of the world and by using a novel instrumental variables 
approach to establish causality. Our results show that this 
reconstruction process was an important driver of growth during the 
post-war decades, not only in Europe but globally, and its impact on 
growth rates lasted until the mid 1970s. Moreover, a counterfactual 
analysis suggests that in the absence of the reconstruction effect 
global growth rates from 1950 to 1975 would have been on average 40% 
lower and only slightly higher than those observed during the years from
 1975 to 2000.</div>

 recent years it has become increasingly frequent to come upon some 
passing mentions or brief discussion of the pioneering invention of the 
marine chronometer by John Harrison (1693-1776), an autodidact Yorkshire
 clockmaker who sought the enormous £20,000 prize that had been offered 
in 1714 by Britain's Parliament. The announced reward was intended to 
encourage the invention of such a device, among other potentially useful
 methods of finding the longitude of a vessel while it was at sea on an 
extended oceanic voyage. Under the terms of the Act of 12 Anne, 1713 
(n.s.1714), the appointed Commissioners of the newly created Board of 
Longitude were authorized to award that sum to whosoever would discover 
or invent an accurate, practical and useful means of finding the 
longitude of a ship at sea. This problem had long been recognized by 
astronomers and mariners to hold the key to accurate ocean navigation, 
and had caught the attention of successive rulers of Europe's leading 
maritime states from the late 16th century onwards. By the early 18th 
century, however, the challenge of providing a solution that could be 
relied upon during long oceanic voyages had emerged as a pressing matter
 of public importance in Britain.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13820_abstract">This
 project hopes to unravel the intellectual history of German 
Ordoliberalism through the lens of the Bundesbank and the emergence of a
 new postwar German central banking tradition. A simplistic explanation -
 one that the Bundesbank itself does not dispel - holds that the 
Bundesbank has been shaped by the twin episodes of hyperinflation in 
Weimar in 1923-1924 and the collapse of Nazi War economy in 1945. Yet, 
this essentialist account of German monetary history provides no idea of
 how German central bankers made sense of this history in reconstructing
 their central bank after the Second World War. The hypothesis driving 
this research is that the missing link is Ordoliberalism. While a 
theoretical literature on Ordoliberalism exists, as well as a body of 
scholarship on German monetary history, the connection between them 
remains unexplored. Understanding the relationship between 
Ordoliberalism and German central banking helps to shed light on the 
evolution of European liberalism, its institutional life and its role in
 the postwar economic reconstruction. The research also sketches out a 
motor of history built on the mutual construction of economic myth and 
the emergence of economic doctrine.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13821_abstract">James
 Buchanan’s final contributions to the post-crisis debate in political 
economy underpinned the necessity to reexamine the legacy of the “Old 
Chicago” School of thought, both by contrasting its ideas to later 
developments in Chicago and by linking it with parallel liberalisms on 
the other side of the Atlantic. This paper follows Buchanan’s plea by 
exploring the central topoi of the 1930’s debate of the Chicago School 
as seen from the work of Henry Simons and discuss its impact on the 
academic arena on both sides of the Atlantic thereafter. With respect to
 this impact, we highlight Hayek as the focal scholar who possibly 
transmits these topoi that later influenced the rise of Freiburgean 
ordoliberalism in Germany from the mid-1930’s onwards as youngest 
archival findings suggest. By revisiting the Mont Pèlerin Society’s 1947
 first meeting’s minutes and papers, we stress the proximity in the 
mindsets of “Old Chicago”, Hayek and the Freiburg School ordo-liberals 
and suggest an explanation for the surprisingly homogenous direction of 
these yet unconnected schools of thought. Utilizing these insights from 
the history of ideas, we re-discuss the intellectual origins of 
Constitutional Political Economy’s research program. Following Viktor 
Vanberg, we argue that CPE can be interpreted as a modernized 
perspective on economics that carries forward three strands of 
transatlantic liberal programs, being precisely “Old Chicago”, Freiburg 
and Hayek. If the genesis of the current crisis and the policy responses
 so far, in the Eurozone and beyond, are interpreted as a failure of 
both fiscal and monetary policy to understand the vital importance of 
rule-based thinking, then the conjoint heritage of political economists 
dedicated to a “laissez-faire with rules” reasoning can provoke a 
crucial impulse: for the political arena, for the economics profession 
and, last but not least, for the individual citizen.</div>

 Gordon Tullock’s 1971 contribution to “Toward Liberty”, the 
multi-language tribute to Ludwig von Mises on his 90th birthday, we read
 how Tullock prefaces his essay: “It may seem odd to place an article 
originally designed for publication in a biological journal in a 
collection of articles to Ludwig von Mises. Among his other 
distinctions, Professor von Mises was among the first to point out that 
economics can be expanded to deal with many areas outside of its 
traditional scope. In my own case, my work in expanding economics into 
new areas was, in a real sense, begun by my reading of Human Action. The
 article below, then, represents my most extreme application of 
economics outside its pre-von Mises boundaries.” (Tullock 1971, 2:375). 
We demonstrate how Tullock’s work on rational predation can be viewed 
organized as describing purposive behavior outside the exchange 
paradigm. This puts Tullock’s world view closer to Walter Eucken’s 
emphasis on politics as power than it does to James Buchanan’s emphasis 
on politics as exchange.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14186_abstract">In the past, studies of Japanese inequality emphasized labor market segmentation between
career-type ("good") jobs and less secure ("bad") jobs that offered lower wages, benefits,
and training. This paper provides novel evidence from the newly available Employment
Status Survey on changes or lack thereof in the nature of labor market segmentation in
Japan from 1982 to 2007. Using two alternative definitions of “good” jobs and “bad” jobs,
and considering self-employment explicitly, we find that the most noteworthy change in
Japan’s labor market segmentation over the last 25 years is a sizeable flow to "bad" jobs
from "bad" types of self-employment, which is considerably larger than the flow from good
to bad jobs and is especially marked for women. These findings cast doubt on the popular
narrative of a large and steady flow of workers from good to bad jobs. However we find
compelling evidence supporting the narrative when it comes to youth, especially young
women, whose share of good jobs rose during the 1980s but has been completely undone
during the Lost Decade.</div>

less than a quarter of a century for the proportion of those aged 65 and over to rise from
7 to 14 percent. With such a rapid demograp hange, we no longer can count on our
current social institutions, which used to be amental to various social systems, as
much as before; in fact, an increase in the number of elderly one-person households has
been witnessed in contemporary Japan. The family/household has been a major arena
for providing basic livelihood security to people, and Japan’s welfare state has strongly
depended on it. I show how this change in household structure, associated with the aging
population, affects income inequality among the elderly.</div>

 distribution is attracting the attention of the public and policy

 and various components of income (wage, transfer payments, financial 
income, etc), I turn to see if the impact is amplified or reduced if one
 takes various demographics aspects into account. For instance, if the 
percentage of income inequality attributed to the Hispanic population

that increase education level for Hispanics would reduce income 
inequality. The data used in the analysis is the consumer expenditure

 is the role of religious institutions and the people working in them on

Decennial Census to construct a pseudo panel of workers in the United

religious workers in the states they were born in in 1960, 1970 and 1980
 predict the differential outcomes between Black and White Non-Hispanic 
workers. My results suggests that living in a state with a one 
percentage point larger density of religious workers increase the 
earnings of black worker by 0.8 percentage points, this estimate 
increases to 1.7 percentage points once  control for the state where the
 worker is currently residing. Importantly, this estimate of the change 
in earnings is largest among black workers who live in a state different
 to the one they were born in, and the estimate among movers suggests a 
3.2 percentage point increase in the earnings of black workers for each 
percentage point increase in the proportion of religious workers.</div>

 study uses 2007–2012 administrative records from New York State’s 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), linked to the 2010 
Census at the person-level and to industry-specific labor market 
indicators at the county-level to estimate the effect of local labor 
conditions on individuals’ likelihood of transitioning out of the 
program. We find that local labor markets matter for the length of time 
individuals spend on SNAP, but there is substantial heterogeneity in 
estimated effects across local industries. While employment growth in 
construction and manufacturing has no impact on SNAP exits, growth in 
local food service and retail employment significantly increases the 
likelihood of a recipient leaving the program in a given month. Notably,
 estimated industry effects vary across race groups, with Black Alone 
non-Hispanic and Hispanic SNAP participants benefiting the least from 
improvements in local labor market conditions. Wage growth in the same 
industries has similar, but more modest, estimated effects. Our models 
include county fixed effects and time-trends, and our results are 
identified by detrended within-county variation in local labor market 
conditions. We confirm that our results are not driven by endogenous 
inter-county mobility or New York City labor markets.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14495_abstract">Consensus
 on the evolution of inequality in America is complicated both by choice
 of dataset and the sources used to define income. Over the past 30 
years, per-capita GDP increased 65 percent, while household-based median
 income rose only 11 percent. More recently, between 1999 and 2010, real
 mean Census Bureau household income fell 5.7 percent, while real per 
capita personal income from the National Income and Product Accounts 
(NIPA) increased 11.1 percent. To reconcile the relationship between 
NIPA-based measures of macroeconomic growth and household income-based 
measures of inequality, we construct a time series combining NIPA and 
Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 1979-2012. First, we calculate
 adjustments that bring NIPA and Census-based definitions of income 
inequality into closer agreement. To address concerns surrounding 
underreported income in the CPS, we match CPS survey respondents to 1040
 income records. Finally, we examine whether and how inequality levels 
and trends are altered after accounting for additional sources of 
income, such as the cash value of Medicare and Medicaid. This paper will
 be informative for policymakers, by providing better information on the
 relationship between national economic output and household well-being.
 Related to this, the proper accounting of in-kind medical benefits will
 help in assessing the relationship between changing transfer program 
policies and inequality trends.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14496_abstract">Since
 welfare reform in 1996, spending on tax credits targeted towards 
low-income families has far surpassed spending on traditional welfare. 
As of 2011, spending on welfare was around 30 billion dollars 
nationally, while the two largest tax credits for low-income families, 
the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), were
 each worth nearly 60 billion dollars. The shift away from delivery of 
transfer income through the welfare system to delivery through the tax 
code means that, instead of receiving a consistent, monthly welfare 
check, many families receive a lump-sum payment when they file their 
taxes each year. While lump-sum delivery of benefits can be a helpful 
savings mechanism to allow families to purchase large items that would 
be otherwise unaffordable (Tach and Halpern-Meekin 2014), it may also 
induce families to take on costly debt throughout the year in 
anticipation of tax refunds come tax time. In this paper, we investigate
 the extent to which the once-a-year timing of benefit payments induces 
families to take on additional unsecured debt. Using the Survey of 
Income and Program Participation (SIPP) wealth topical modules from 1990
 to 2008, we use a simulated instruments approach to estimate the impact
 of tax credit program expansions on household credit card debt. 
Preliminary evidence suggests increases in tax credit generosity are 
associated with increases in credit card and other unsecured debt. Using
 the Consumer Finance Monthly survey (CFM), we then show a seasonal 
pattern of debt accumulation for low-income households that reflects the
 once-a-year timing of benefits structure: low-income households are 
much more likely to pay down their debt in the months surrounding tax 
filing compared to their higher-income counterparts, while there is 
little or no difference in their debt accumulation and payoff compared 
to higher-income families throughout the rest of the year.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14497_abstract">Recent
 literature on entrepreneurship (e.g., Fairlie, 2013) has examined the 
individual characteristics and local economic conditions associated with
 becoming self-employed. This paper extends the existing literature by 
examining self-employment duration for those becoming self-employed 
during the Great Recession versus the pre-recessionary period. Using two
 separate panels of CPS ASEC data (2005-06 and 2007-08) linked to tax 
data for the 2005-2013 period, we explore whether self-employment 
duration is lower for the cohort that becomes self-employed during the 
Great Recession relative to the cohort entering self-employment prior to
 the recession.  In addition, we examine whether the characteristics 
associated with longer self-employment duration differ between the two 
cohorts. Initial results indicate that those transitioning into 
self-employment during the Great Recession have shorter self-employment 
spells than those becoming self-employed prior to the recession.  
Meanwhile, we also find some preliminary evidence that certain 
demographic characteristics are associated with shorter self-employment 
spells, regardless of when entering into self-employment occurs.  
However, the association between some demographic characteristic and 
self-employment duration seems to be stronger in one cohort versus the 
other.  The results of the paper may help improve our understanding of 
the relationship between economic downturns and self-employment.</div>

bloated financial sector, the expansion of patent and copyright 
protection, and protectionist policies to benefit highly paid 
professionals. The paper produces a range of estimates of amount of 
additional income going to high-income households from each source. It

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14354_abstract">The
 objective of this paper is to build a dynamic framework to depict the 
timing of the building of a supply chain for a representative firm after
 it generates a disembodied technology innovation that creates value 
added for processing raw product. Since the innovation is not 
patentable, market concentration for the final product decreases over 
time. The optimality condition for the innovator suggests that the 
marginal cost of resources for securing feedstock is the discounted sum 
of resources allocated to the building of processing capacity, which has
 implications for market share of the final product in the long run. The
 model suggests that: first, higher initial value added of the 
innovation may deter the building of a supply chain; second, in the 
steady state equilibrium, the number of firms in the sector is 
independent of the capital structure of the firms.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14355_abstract">Food
 industry and agribusiness firms are dynamically innovating on 
technologies cum products. To realize those innovations they develop 
contracts with suppliers and buyers, and innovate institutionally and 
organizationally in the development of value chains to procure or market
 the product. The three-way linkages among innovations in 
technology/products, innovations in/development of supply chains, and 
design and implementation of contracts, have not or rarely been explored
 in the context of agrifood firms rapidly expanding their operations in 
developing country markets. This paper combines a theoretical 
development of this with illustrations from horticulture and meat and 
fish markets in Asia and Europe. The cases show how the use of joint 
ventures and contracted \follow sourcing" have been used by lead firms 
to require, facilitate, or encourage suppliers of processing, wholesale,
 or logistics support in the origin market to transfer technology to and
 build the capacities of suppliers in the developing country market to 
use the new technologies. This \fast tracks" supply chain development in
 the emerging markets for the lead firm investing and transacting there.</div>

 chains in the agrifood sector are undergoing a rapid process of 
modernization, characterized by the emergence of private standards and 
different systems of vertical value chain governance. In this article we
 investigate the technological implications of these developments at the
 farm-level. We explicitly modelled the conditions under which 
technology transfer and adoption will occur in a value chain setting and
 reviewed the corresponding evidence on these issues. We find that 
technology transfer within a value chain can occur in an environment 
with imperfect credit and technology markets, but depends on the surplus
 generated by the technology, the holdup opportunities of the supplier 
and the type of technology. Finally, using these findings we discuss the
 implications of public investment and the role of private standards as a
 potential catalyst for technology adoption and transfer.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12465_abstract">We
 investigate how borrowers' experiences of inflation affect their choice
 of mortgage loan. A growing literature on experience effects suggests 
that individuals overweight their life-time experiences of 
marco-economic outcomes when forming expectations. We investigate 
whether borrowers with higher life-time inflation experiences demand 
greater insurance against increases in nominal interest rates and, 
hence, over-pay for fixed-rate mortgages. We estimate that every 
additional percentage point of experienced inflation increases a 
borrower's willingness to pay for a fixed rate mortgage between 6 and 21
 basis points of the FRM contract rate, as compared to an adjustable 
rate mortgage. Since individuals with access to the full history of 
inflation should place a weight of zero on the inflation they have 
personally experienced, these biased expectations have a major impact on
 the product mix of FRMs versus ARMs. Moreover, this bias is 
welfare-reducing ex post. 

We simulate counterfactual mortgage payments and estimate that among 
switching households, the average mortgagor in 1991 or 2001 was 
overpaying by approximately $1,100 per year for the embedded inflation 
insurance of the FRM. In present value terms, the average switching 
mortgagor in 1986 overpaid by $30 to $50 thousand dollars ex post, if 
they held the contract through 2013.</div>

 lenders are increasingly moving online as risk of federal regulation 
becomes imminent  Risk of default and fraud, however, are higher for 
online lenders, so these lenders often charge interest and fees higher 
than the traditional payday loan rates of 300-500% APR. We study the 
consequences of borrowing on online payday loans using a fuzzy 
regression-kink design. This quasi-experimental approach exploits the 
fact that how much a customer borrows consist of two components: the 
endogenous choice on the customer’s part and the exogenous constraints 
of company rules and state loan caps. Our technique allows us to 
estimate the causal effect of borrowing on a relatively larger online 
payday loan. Our first stage estimates reveal that online customers are 
extremely credit constrained, borrowing a high proportion of the amount 
offered to them. We then estimate the effect of a $100 larger online 
payday loans on 1) total subsequent indebtedness on any type of subprime
 credit, 2) late payment and and 3) default.  We are able to separate 
default resulting from adverse selection versus moral hazard</div>

 calculate the socially optimal level of illiquidity in a stylized 
retirement savings system. We solve the planner’s problem in an economy 
in which time-inconsistent households face a tradeoff between commitment
 and flexibility (Amador, Werning and Angeletos, 2006).  We assume that 
the planner can set up multipleaccounts for households: a perfectly 
liquid account and N partially illiquid retirement savings accounts with
 early withdrawal penalties, 0%  &lt;  ≤  100%.  Revenue from penalties 
is collected by the government and redistributed through the tax system.
  We solve for the socially optimal values of these penalties, {}, and 
the socially optimal allocations to these accounts.  When agents have 
heterogeneous present-biased preferences, the socially optimal system 
has three accounts: (i) a liquid account, (ii) an account with an early 
withdrawal penalty of  ≈ 100%, and (iii) an account with an early 
withdrawal penalty of ≈ 10%. With heterogeneous preferences, the 
socially optimal retirement savings system in our stylized model looks 
surprisingly like the existing U.S. system: (i) a liquid account, (ii) 
an illiquid Social Security account (and defined benefit pensions), and 
(iii) a 401(k)/IRA account with a 10% penalty.  The socially optimal 
allocations to these accounts and the predicted equilibrium flows of 
early withdrawals -- “leakage” -- also match the U.S. system</div>

 Shah and Shafir argue that scarcity, defined as “having less than you 
feel you need” impedes cognitive functioning, which in turn may lead to 
decision-making errors and myopic behavior. We study if the level of 
economic recourses influences the borrowers' decision making by 
exploiting within borrower variation in the number of days between 
consecutive paydays. In Sweden, everyones salaries are typically paid on
 the 25th of each month. However no transfers are made on weekend- and 
national holidays which causes the number of days between pay-days in 
Sweden to vary significantly between months and years.  We use this 
exogenous variation in the level of economic recourses before payday to 
empirically investigate if credit choice is influenced by economic 
circumstances. For this purpose we utilize a ten year panel of 100.000 
low income households' that includes their repeated credit contract 
choice and repayment behavior in both the mainstream- and alternative 
credit market.</div>

 estimate the causal effect of corporation tax on small business 
incorporation and investment by exploring cross-sectional variation in 
the impact of a 2006/07 tax reform in a difference-in-differences 
design. Analyzing the population of UK corporation tax records from 
2001/02 to 2008/09, we present three findings. First, a one percentage 
point increase in the tax gains to incorporate increases the number of 
newly incorporated companies by around 2-4.5%. Second, there is a strong
 cash flow effect of taxes on corporate investment. On average, a one 
percentage point increase in the average tax rate reduces investment 
rate by about 2.2 percentage points. Third, the cash flow effect of 
corporation taxes on investment is most pronounced for newly 
incorporated firms, and diminishes over time as companies begin to 
establish a track record of providing credible information for bank 
loans. The empirical evidence suggests that incorporation lowers the 
cost of external finance for small businesses by reducing the 
information cost of borrowing. Small business incorporation leads to 
more investment and implies potential welfare gains for the larger

 a sample of over 27 million establishments of U.S. firms with 
activities in more than one state, we estimate the impact of state 
business taxation on business activity at the intensive and extensive 
margins. Only firms organized as subchapter C corporations are subject 
to the corporate tax code, whereas the income of partnerships, 
sole-proprietorships, and S corporations is passed through annually to 
the firm’s owners and taxed at individual rates. For C corporations, 
both employment at existing establishments (intensive margin) and the 
number of establishments in the state (extensive margin) have corporate 
tax elasticities of –0.4. In the control group of pass-through entities,
 there is no response to the corporate tax code. However, the business 
activity of pass-through entities responds to the personal tax code in 
an analogous fashion, with tax elasticities of –0.2 to –0.3. Around half
 of the effects are driven by reallocation of productive resources to 
other states where the treated firms have establishments. Capital shows 
similar patterns but is 36% less elastic than labor. A narrative 
approach confirms that the results are robust and strongest in the 
sample of tax changes that were implemented due to inherited budget 
deficits, long-run goals, or cross-state variation caused by Federal tax
 reforms.</div>

 vaccinations save millions of lives in an extremely cost-effective way,
 take-up is much lower than the optimal level in developing countries. 
This paper causally evaluates the relative importance of psychic costs 
as channels for low vaccination take-up compared to other barriers: 
monetary costs and priming about disease severity.  I measure each 
channel by evaluating a field experiment among women which randomizes 
several factors that affect tetanus vaccine take-up in rural Nigeria. 
This is the first study to report the experimental evidence on psychic 
costs of vaccination. Although conventional wisdom drawn from 
observational studies highlights the relevance of psychic costs, I found
 no evidence that psychic costs limit vaccination take-up. 95.7 percent 
of women who were incentivized just to show up at a clinic, 
unconditional on vaccine take-up, chose to receive the vaccine anyway. 
Priming about disease severity using salient images of tetanus patients 
increased perceived costs of disease but did not affect vaccination 
take-up. Rather than these psychic costs being important barriers, 
direct cash incentives had the largest effects on vaccination take-up. 
Small cash incentives increased vaccination take-up by almost 20 
percentage points from 55 percent. The results in this paper confirm 
economic barriers to take-up and find no evidence that psychic costs 
play a significant role, at least among more than 85 percent of 
respondents who responded to cash incentives.</div>

 in September 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended dependent 
health insurance coverage to young adults up to age 26. Since young 
adults undergo frequent transitions in jobs and schools, many face 
additional challenges as they age out of dependent coverage. This study 
focuses on how young adults went through the aging-out process, 
especially: (1) Did they exhibit “use it before you lose it” behavior by
 using more health care in the last year under dependent coverage? (2) 
How did their insurance status change after aging out? To answer 
question (1), I derived evidence from a large insurance claims database 
and examined healthcare utilization measured by inpatient hospital 
admissions, outpatient visits, emergency room visits, and prescription 
drug claims. For (2), I followed individuals from a longitudinal survey 
on their insurance status changes and analyzed factors associated with 
uninsured spells after aging out. Results reject the hypothesis that 
aging-out individuals exhibited “use it before you lose it” behavior. In
 addition, the uninsured rate among aged-out individuals declined, in a 
few months, to a level lower than that of young adults prior to ACA. 
Factors related to longer uninsured spells were also discussed.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11761_abstract">A
 kidney transplant is a life-saving treatment for end-stage renal 
disease. Transplantable kidneys can come from living or deceased donors,
 but neither source of supply is keeping up with the growing demand. 
This study focuses on a model state law drafted in 2006, which has been 
enacted in 46 states and the District of Columbia as the Revised Uniform
 Anatomical Gift Act. The Act includes several measures that could 
increase supply of deceased donor kidneys. I use an event study approach
 to estimate the full effect of the Act on the supply of kidneys for 
transplant. The estimate is identified by arguably exogenous differences
 in timing of enactment across states over a seven year period. I find 
that the number of deceased donors of kidneys increases by five to seven
 percent as a result. The main channel for this effect is organ recovery
 from registered donors where unavailability or conflict among surviving
 family members would have prevented organ recovery under prior law. I 
find suggestive evidence of a corresponding reduction in living donors 
of kidneys, an indirect consequence of this law governing deceased organ
 donations. </div>

 introduce the concept of financial competence, a measure of the extent 
to which individuals' financial choices align with those they would make
 if they properly understood their opportunity sets. Unlike existing 
measures of the quality of financial decision making, the concept is 
firmly rooted in the principles of choice-based behavioral welfare 
analysis; it also avoids the types of paternalistic judgments that are 
common in policy discussions. We document the importance of assessing 
financial competence by demonstrating, through an example, that an 
educational intervention can appear highly successful according to 
conventional outcome measures while failing to improve the quality of 
financial decision making. Specifically, we study a simple intervention 
concerning compound interest that significantly improves performance on a
 test of conceptual knowledge (which subjects report operationalizing in
 their decisions), and appears to counteract exponential growth bias. 
However, financial competence (welfare) does not improve. We trace the 
mechanisms that account for these seemingly divergent findings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12584_abstract">This
 paper presents new evidence on heterogeneity in the propensity to 
misreact to complex or not-fully-salient incentives, and shows that 
accounting for this heterogeneity is crucial in economic and policy 
analysis. Focusing on the concrete setting of consumer underreaction to 
not-fully-salient sales taxes, we show theoretically that 1) individual 
differences in underreaction generate inefficiency in the resulting 
allocation of the taxed good, 2) the variation of underreaction across 
the income distribution affects the regressivity of the tax burden, and 
3) the variation of underreaction across different tax rates affects the
 distortions to demand resulting from tax changes. To empirically assess
 the importance of these issues, we implement an online shopping 
experiment in which 3000 consumers—matching the U.S. adult population on
 key demographics—purchase common household products, facing tax rates 
that vary in size and salience. We find that: 1) there are significant 
individual differences in underreaction to taxes. Accounting for this 
heterogeneity increases the efficiency cost of taxation estimates by at 
least 200%, as compared to estimates generated from a representative 
behavioral agent model. 2) High income earners are less likely to 
underreact to taxes than low income earners. The fourth quartile of the 
income distribution is roughly twice as attentive as the first quartile,
 and thus the financial burden of misoptimization falls 
disproportionately on the poor. 3) Tripling currently existing sales tax
 rates roughly doubles consumers' attention to taxes, which implies that
 raising taxes increases deadweight loss through an additional 
“debiasing channel.” Our results provide new insights into the 
mechanisms and determinants of boundedly rational processing of 
not-fully-salient incentives, and our general approach provides a 
framework for robust behavioral welfare analysis in other markets and 
domains.</div>

 consumers have limited information, their willingness-to-pay for one 
product versus another may not reflect the true difference in product 
value consumers would experience upon consumption. Consequently, 
consumer demand estimates may not be sufficient to determine optimal 
policies in markets such as health insurance, where past empirical work 
has documented substantial information and choice frictions. In this 
paper we develop a simple model of insurance market equilibrium with 
information frictions and use this model to study how these frictions 
impact positive market outcomes (e.g. adverse selection) as well as 
social welfare. Our model highlights how policies that reduce consumer 
frictions (e.g. via information provision) can have both level effects 
that impact average willingness-to-pay for a given product and sorting 
effects that re-order consumers along the demand and cost curves, 
changing the nature of risk-based selection. We use this framework to 
study (i) demand-side policies that reduce consumer frictions and (ii) a
 supply-side policy, insurer risk-adjustment transfers, that is designed
 to mitigate adverse selection. We study the key predictions of the 
model using proprietary data on insurance choices, utilization, and 
consumer information from a large firm. We leverage estimates from prior
 work with these data, where large information frictions exist, to show 
that such frictions have important implications for equilibrium 
outcomes, adverse selection, and welfare in a counterfactual competitive
 insurance exchange. In that market, eliminating frictions substantially
 increases adverse selection, reducing the share enrolling in more 
generous coverage from 85% to 9%. Risk-adjustment transfers have a small
 impact when frictions are present, but when frictions are reduced this 
supply-side policy substantially improves welfare and increases the 
share enrolled in more generous coverage from 9% to 64%. Our results 
document (i) the importance of both level and sorting effects and (ii) 
the importance of understanding supply-side vs. demand-side policy 
interactions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10138_abstract">A
 large scale field experiment – a resume correspondence study – was used
 to collect the data needed to address two fundamental limitations of 
existing field experiments testing for age discrimination.  The first 
limitation arises because the usual procedure in these studies of making
 older and younger applicants identical likely generates bias in favor 
of finding age discrimination.  We provide a legal and policy basis for 
modifying the design of such an experiment to give older applicants 
experience commensurate with their age.  The second limitation arises 
because greater unobserved differences in human capital investment of 
older applicants implies that existing field experiments are likely 
biased against finding age discrimination.  This problem is addressed by
 collecting the required data to implement the method in Neumark (2012) 
to eliminate this bias.  Finally, we use a variety of job profiles for 
older workers to test for differences associated with transitions to 
less demanding jobs (“bridge jobs”) at older ages.</div>

 hiring discrimination has been found in many audit studies and 
laboratory experiments, little is known about how, why, and for whom 
this discrimination occurs.  This paper combines the new technologies of
 resume randomization and eye-tracking within a laboratory setting to 
get a clearer picture of the mechanics of discrimination.  MBA, MPA, HR,
 and business students participated in this laboratory study.  Each was 
shown 40 resumes with randomized inputs for hypothetical high school 
graduate applicants to a clerical position which they rated on a Likert 
(1-7) scale.  They then choose two resumes for interview purposes.  
During this process of rating, their eye movements were tracked, showing
 where and for how long they looked at relevant portions of each resume.
  We found strong evidence of (quadratic) age discrimination based on 
date of high school graduation as well as evidence for race 
discrimination based on names.  We did not find direct evidence of 
gender discrimination, but gender interacts with race and age.  Results 
on race-by-age are particularly striking, with black resumes starting at
 a lower level but eventually becoming preferred over white resumes for 
this entry-level job, while white resumes show the opposite pattern.  
Participants also spent longer times looking at younger resumes compared
 to older resumes, and longer looking at white resumes compared to black
 resumes, but spent longer looking at resume items that could indicate 
potential statistical discrimination for older resumes.  These results 
highlight the importance of the intersection of group characteristics 
for fully understanding the labor market demand for different types of 
workers.</div>

 regaining employment, even at a menial job, help unemployed workers' 
job prospects, or is taking a low-paying job as a stop-gap while 
searching for better matches hurtful? This is an important open 
question, especially for hard-to-reemploy groups, such as older workers 
or long-term unemployed workers. We examine the role of taking an 
"interim job," of age, and of unemployment duration on the incidence of 
call back rates based on a large number of fictitious resumes send to 
actual online job postings for low-skill white collar clerical jobs. We 
obtain three main findings. First, in contrast to the influential work 
of Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013), we find no relationship between
 callback rates and the duration of unemployment. This difference can be
 attributed to the age of our applicants, all of whom are older than 35.
 Second, we find that taking an interim job significantly reduces the 
likelihood of receiving a callback. Third, older workers are 
significantly less likely to receive a callback.</div>

 paper analyzes the general equilibrium effects of capital account 
intervention in a developing country with learning externalities. We 
describe an economy that experiences learning-by-investing externalities
 as it converges towards the world technological frontier. We compare 
the time paths of investment and technological growth in a decentralized
 setting with their counterparts in a planning equilibrium and show that
 a planner will increase investment to take advantage of the learning 
externalities. This can be achieved directly or indirectly by 
accumulating reserves and undervaluing the country's real exchange rate.
 In a multi-country setting, one country's intervention makes it more 
expensive for other developing countries to intervene but benefits 
advanced economies through terms-of-trade effects. If all countries take
 world market prices as given, the resulting equilibrium is nonetheless 
Pareto efficient. By contrast, if a country internalizes its market 
power, it would reduce the extent of undervaluation and grow 
inefficiently slowly.</div>

 knowledge of Ponzi schemes in the accounting and finance literatures is
 mainly anecdotal. The consequence of this is that it is difficult to 
know what, if anything, can be done to deter these frauds. We seek to 
fill part of our knowledge gap about Ponzi schemes by providing 
large-scale evidence based on a sample of 376 Ponzi schemes prosecuted 
by the SEC between 1988 and 2012. Our evidence indicates that the 
majority of SEC-prosecuted schemes involve sums that are much lower than
 those in the highly visible frauds perpetrated by Bernard Madoff and 
Allen Stanford. The mean duration of Ponzi schemes in our sample is 
about four years and these schemes have a mean (median) average 
per-investor investment of around $431,700 ($87,800). Ponzi schemes are 
more likely to occur in U.S. states where the citizenry is inherently 
more trusting. The ex post success of a Ponzi scheme (as measured by 
duration, total amount invested, or the percentage cut to perpetrators)

 prices cannot be the outcome of a rational efficient market if 
fundamental analysis based on public information is profitable. Our 
approach to fundamental analysis estimates the intrinsic fair values of 
stocks from the most common quarterly balance sheet and income statement
 items that were last reported in Compustat. Taking the view of a 
statistician with little knowledge of the theory of finance, we show 
that the most basic form of fundamental analysis yields trades with 
risk-adjusted returns of up to 9% per year. The trading strategy relies 
on convergence of market prices to their fair values. The greatest rate 
of convergence occurs in the month after the mispricing signal and 
subsequently decays to zero over the subsequent 28 months. Profits from 
trading are present for both large and small firms in economically 
significant magnitudes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12920_abstract">In
 this paper, we study the manner in which banks design and issue 
liabilities that facilitate trade among their customers. A bank 
mitigates a lemon problem by offering ex-ante lines of credit to their 
customers. Ex-post, some of these customers find it optimal to use their
 line of credit by pledging and revealing private information about 
their collateral. In exchange, these customers receive a deposit-like 
bank liability, which they subsequently use as a means of payment. In 
the optimal banking contract, the bank remains opaque about the private 
information; the liability is less risky than the underlying collateral;
 and the bank uses its capital to absorb losses in bad states of the 
world. We show that, with multiple banks, liabilities circulate and are 
guaranteed by the assets of the banking systems. We find that negative 
shocks to collateral value may propagate in the entire banking system.</div>

 risk-taking ever a privately optimal response to agency problems within
 banks? In a model where borrower types only matter for safe projects, I
 show that the answer to this question depends on the nature of the 
agency problem – that is, whether loan officers are hired to screen or 
whether they are hired to both screen and monitor. Incentivizing 
screening favors no risk-taking but involves a non-monotone relationship
 between performance and compensation. This non-monotonicity undermines 
incentives to monitor so, when both screening and monitoring are 
important, the bank instead prefers a strategy which pushes low types 
into risky projects. That selected risk-taking emerges under impediments
 to non-monotone compensation is also illustrated in an environment with
 rank-order tournaments and no monitoring.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12923_abstract">We
 explore a model in which banks strategically securitize assets and 
create opaque portfolios that interferes with investors' decisions and 
leads to more banking crises. In our set-up, banks borrow funds from 
investors in order to finance risky projects. When debt is issued, the 
banks, as well as the investors are uninformed about the outcome of the 
projects. Before maturity, however, investors observe a signal about 
their bank's project, and can decide whether they liquidate their debt 
early against a redemption value. Ex-ante, each bank can affect how 
investors use their information by securitizing a fraction of their 
project in exchange for another bank's project. This way, banks can 
create an optimal degree of information asymmetry such that investors 
continue their debt contract only in those states that are most 
favorable to banks. Thus, while traditionally securitization arises as a
 strategic response of the borrower who has better information than the 
lender, in our model securitization itself is the source of information 
asymmetry. We characterize banks' optimal portfolio allocation. We show 
that when securitization takes places in equilibrium, banking crises are
 more likely to occur and welfare is lower. Our model is suggestive that
 government interventions and bailout policies can only increase the 
probability of banking crises by further distorting banks' incentives, 
and thus are inefficient.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21684_abstract">Recent
 and prospective reforms of mortgage finance have and could further 
affect house prices and construction by affecting not only mortgage 
interest rates, but also mortgage credit standards facing first-time 
home-buyers. Our econometric models of house prices are rich enough to 
simulate the impact of potential reforms via both mortgage interest 
rates and loan-to-value (LTV) constraints. As Duca, Muellbauer, and 
Murphy (2010, 2011) show, the recent swings in U.S. house prices largely
 arose from shifts in mortgage lending standards facing first-time home 
buyers, measured using a cyclically-adjusted LTV ratio. Our estimates 
indicate that ending the small interest rate subsidy from Fannie and 
Freddie would have minor effects on housing. However, changes in 
mortgage regulations that alter downpayment and debt service 
requirements on mortgages could have a much larger effect.  Recent and 
prospective changes in regulations need to be evaluate d using house 
prices models such as ours (Duca, Muellbauer, and Murphy, 2011, 2012, 
2013b), which account for changing mortgage lending standards. Extending
 our earlier house price research, we incorporate the supply of new 
housing and simulate the likely dynamics of house prices and 
construction along the transition paths to potential post-GSE reform 
equilibria.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21685_abstract">This
 paper identifies the impact of borrowing constraints on homeownership 
in the U.S. in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The existence
 of credit rationing in the U.S. mortgage market means that some 
households for whom it would be optimal to choose to be homeowners may 
not be able to do so. Borrowers with certain wealth, income and credit 
characteristics are unable to obtain a loan even if they are willing to 
pay a higher cost of credit (Linneman and Wachter 1989). The Stiglitz 
and Weiss (1981) canonical model sets up the rationale for this credit 
rationing. Using data from the 2001, 2007 and 2013 Surveys of Consumer 
Finance (SCF), this paper measures the impact of changes in the income, 
wealth and credit constraints on the probability of homeownership. 
Credit supply eased and then became considerably more restricted in the 
wake of the Great Recession. The loosening of borrowing constraints was 
accompanied by an increase in homeownership to 69 percent. In this paper
 we estimate the role the tightening of credit has had on the 
probability of individual households to become homeowners and the 
decline in the aggregate homeownership rate to 64%. In addition, we 
incorporate models that investigate the impact of macroeconomic and 
local economic conditions and demographic shifts&nbsp;(Gabriel and 
Rosenthal,&nbsp;2015) to forecast the likelihood of continuing declines 
into the future.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21687_abstract">The
 sensitivity of housing demand to mortgage rates and available leverage 
is key to understanding the effect of monetary and macroprudential 
policies on the housing market. However, since there is generally no 
exogenous variation in these variables that is independent of 
confounding factors (such as economic conditions or household 
characteristics), it is difficult to cleanly estimate these 
sensitivities empirically. We circumvent these issues by designing a 
strategic survey in which respondents are asked for their willingness to
 pay (WTP) for a home comparable to their current one, under different 
financing scenarios. We vary mortgage rates, down payment constraints, 
and non-housing wealth. We find that a relaxation of down payment 
constraints, or an exogenous increase in non-housing wealth, has large 
effects on WTP, especially for relatively poorer and more 
credit-constrained borrowers. On the other hand, changing the mortgage 
rate by 2 percentage points only changes WTP by about 5 percent on 
average. These findings have implications for theoretical models of 
house price determination, as well as for policy.</div>

 literature on behavioral responses to changes in wages and tax rates 
typically assumes that responses to wage/tax increases and wage/tax 
decreases are symmetric. However, a long literature following 
\shortciteN{Kahnemann-1979} has established that individuals are loss 
averse and perceive changes in the loss domain differently than changes 
in the gain domain. This behavioral may imply that elasticity estimates 
that are identified from wage/tax decreases are not comparable to 
estimates that are identified based on wage/tax increases. We are not 
aware of any evidence that directly tests if wage/tax increases have the
 same effect as wage/tax decreases. This  paper aims to fill this gap. 
Our precise research questions are: does labor supply respond 
symmetrically to increases and decreases in wages? does labor supply 
respond symmetrically to increases and decreases in tax rates? We aim to
 overcome any empirical challenges using two strategies. First, we 
implement a randomized experiment in the online labor market Mechanical 
Turk to study if wage increases have symmetric labor supply effects as 
wage decreases. Second, we run laboratory experiments to study the same 
question in the context of taxation. That is, we test in the lab if 
lab-labor supply responds symmetrically to tax-rate decreases and 
increases.</div>

conditional on an offer, they are offered lower pay, fewer benefits, and
 less hours. Despite this, they are more likely to accept these 
lower-quality job offers but are also much more likely to again engage 
in job search on their new job. In contrast, employed job seekers 
receive a higher fraction of both solicited and unsolicited job offers, 
and tend to generate many offers from referral networks with ties to 
their professional acquaintances. In fact, many employed workers are not
 seeking new work at all, and yet tend to generate more plentiful and

made. From the data and the model, we identify the distributions of four
 key variables: offered wages, offered non-wage job values, the value of
 the job-seeker's non-work alternative, and the job-seeker's personal 
productivity. We find that, conditional on personal productivity, the 
dispersion of offered wages is moderate, accounting for 21 percent of 
the total variation in observed offered wages, whereas the dispersion of
 the non-wage component of offered job values is substantially larger. 
We relate our findings to an influential recent paper by Hornstein, 
Krusell, and Violante who called attention to the tension between the 
fairly high dispersion of the values job-seekers assign to their job

take the form of wage floors (dependent, for instance, on a worker's job
 history), hiring and firing restrictions, automatic promotions, and 
constraints to pay growth. What are the implications of these 
regulations for individual employment and wage dynamics and for the 
aggregate wage distribution? We answer this question by developing and 
estimating an equilibrium model of the Italian labor market using 
matched employer-employee data from the Work Histories Italian Panel 
(WHIP) merged with unique information on the constraints implied by 
national collective labor agreements (Contratto Collettivo Nazionale del
 Lavoro or CCNL). In the model ex-ante skill-heterogeneous workers and 
homogeneous firms match frictionlessly and are subject to the most 
salient regulations implied by CCNLs. The model can replicate, 
qualitatively and quantitatively, the main features of the dynamics of 
employment and wages: unemployment to employment and job-to-job 
transitions, wage growth with tenure and experience, and downward wage 
rigidities. It can also largely explain the cross-sectional distribution
 of wages. Absent the labor market regulations we consider, the model 
would generate counterfactual predictions about the dynamics of wages 
and unemployment. Based on these results, we conclude that policy 
frictions offer an explanation for the dynamics of wages and employment 
observed in European labor markets that is naturally complementary to 
that provided by search frictions. We also show that the labor market 
regulations we consider have important complementary effects on 
employment and wages. Thus, assessing the impact of changes in one of 
these regulations while ignoring the existence of the others can lead to
 incorrect inferences about the effect of common labor market reform 
proposals.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11268_abstract">This
 paper examines the relationship between labor market size and job 
search outcomes. Much research and many policy initiatives assume that 
larger labor markets lead to better job search outcomes because they 
give workers and firms more choice in potential jobs or employees. The 
empirical finding that labor market size and job finding rates are 
uncorrelated, however, has led researchers to question this assumption. I
 show, theoretically and empirically, that large labor markets may cause
 workers to find jobs that are better matches given their individual 
skills and characteristics, even if they do not cause workers to find 
jobs faster. I construct a unique new data set from Denmark that 
combines administrative data, an online vacancy database and detailed 
geographical information. I show that workers in large labor markets 
find jobs for which they are a better match as measured by both previous
 industry experience and geographical location. They also find jobs 
which pay higher wages and result in longer employment spells even after
 controlling for spatial productivity differences among firms. The 
estimated effects imply that labor market size explains 6.6% of the 
spatial variation in wage premia, and also suggest a high rate of return
 on transport infrastructure projects that increase the effective size 
of labor markets by increasing workers' ability to commute to distant 
jobs.</div>

 paper combines income tax returns with Flow of Funds data to estimate 
the distribution of household wealth in the United States since 1913. We
 estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual 
taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We
 successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets 
where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer 
Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax 
records. Wealth concentration has followed a U-shaped evolution over the
 last 100 years: It was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, 
fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The 
rise of wealth inequality is almost entirely due to the rise of the top 
0.1% wealth share, from 7% in 1979 to 22% in 2012—a level almost as high
 as in 1929. The bottom 90% wealth share first increased up to the 
mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth 
concentration is due to the surge of top incomes combined with an 
increase in saving rate inequality. Top wealth-holders are younger today
 than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of total labor income in 
the economy. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey 
of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11899_abstract">Administrative
 tax data indicates that U.S. top income and wealth shares are 
substantial and increasing rapidly in recent decades (Piketty and Saez  
2003, Saez and Zucman 2014). A key reason for using administrative data 
to measure top shares is overcoming the under-representation of families
 at the very top that plagues most household surveys. However, tax 
records restrict the unit of analysis for measuring economic resources 
and limit the concepts of income and wealth being measured. The Survey 
of Consumer Finances (SCF) solves the under-representation problem by 
combining administrative and survey data (Bricker, et al, 2014). The 
administrative records are used to select the SCF sample and verify that
 high-end families are appropriately represented, and the survey is 
designed to measure comprehensive concepts of income and wealth. As in 
the administrative tax data, the SCF shows high and rising top income 
and wealth shares, though the levels and trends are more muted. 
Reconciling the SCF measures with estimates derived directly from income
 tax records indicates how broadening the concepts of income and wealth 
and smoothing over transitory income fluctuations directly impacts top 
shares.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11900_abstract">Wealth
 is heavily concentrated at the upper tail of the wealth distribution. I
 investigate the reliability of upper tail wealth estimates from 
household wealth surveys in the presence of survey differential 
non-response, i.e. the fact that richer households have lower response 
rates than poorer households. Differential non-response biases tail 
wealth estimates downwards. Monte Carlo evidence shows that such a bias 
can be quite substantial. I provide a method that greatly reduces the 
bias. The method combines survey data with data from rich lists and uses
 them jointly to estimate a Pareto (power-law) distribution for tail 
wealth. Using this method, the paper combines the US Survey of Consumer 
Finances, the UK Wealth and assets survey and the Eurosystem’s Household
 Finance and Consumption Survey  data with Forbes World’s billionaires 
data to provide new estimates of tail wealth in the US, UK and nine euro
 area countries. For surveys with low or no oversampling of the wealthy,
 these estimates indicate a much higher concentration of wealth at the 
top than those calculated from the wealth surveys alone.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11901_abstract">It
 is a well-known fact that the distribution of wealth is extremely 
skewed, a phenomenon known as "Pareto Law". What produces the Pareto Law
 has been the subject of a lively debate, together with the related 
issues of what produces persistence in the distribution of wealth across
 generations. One large strand of literature has focused on households 
facing idiosyncratic and uninsurable labor income (i.e., human capital) 
risk. However, while idiosyncratic shocks to labor income can explain 
some of the inequality we observe in the data, they are not enough to 
produce the extent of wealth inequality found in the data and even less 
so the right tail of the distribution, since at high levels of wealth 
the incentives to accumulate precautionary assets (and thus induce a 
thick tail) fade away. A recent literature attempts to address the 
discrepancy between theory and data by allowing for idiosyncratic 
returns to wealth. Provided the returns to wealth have an important 
individual-specific component and provided that these returns tend to 
persist over time (and across generations), these models can generate a 
stationary distribution of wealth with a thick right tail populated by 
those who have been lucky (or expert) enough to get a repeated sequence 
of high returns to wealth. But how much heterogeneity in returns to 
wealth do we see in the data? How much intergenerational persistence is 
there? More generally, what are the empirical properties of the returns 
to wealth? In this project we aim at answering these questions and 
assessing whether idiosyncratic returns to wealth can help explaining 
the empirical distribution of wealth and, in particular, whether it is 
able to generate the thick right tail. The empirical analysis will rely 
on administrative wealth data from Norway.</div>

 document three new facts about the industry-level response to minimum 
wage hikes. First, restaurant exit and entry both rise following a hike.
 Second, the rise in entry is concentrated in chains, which we show to 
be more capital-intensive. Third, there is no change in employment among
 continuing restaurants. We develop a model of industry dynamics based 
on putty-clay technology and show that it is consistent with these 
facts. In the model, continuing restaurants cannot change employment, 
and thus industry-level adjustment occurs through exit of 
labor-intensive restaurants and entry of capital-intensive ones. We show
 these three facts are inconsistent with other models of industry 
dynamics.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13433_abstract">This
 paper analyzes the effects of a large (~60%) and persistent increase in
 the minimum wage instituted in Hungary in 2001. We propose a new 
approach to estimating the employment effects of a minimum wage increase
 that exploits information on the distribution of wages before and after
 the policy change. We infer the number of jobs destroyed by comparing 
the number of pre-reform jobs below the new minimum wage to the excess 
number of jobs paying at (and above) the new minimum wage. Our estimates
 imply that the higher minimum wage had at most a small negative effect 
on employment, and so the main effect was pushing up wages. We then use 
data on a large panel of firms to evaluate the economic incidence of the
 minimum wage increase. Contrary to theoretical models that attribute 
the small employment effects of minimum wage changes to monopsonistic 
wage setting, we find no evidence that the rise in the minimum wage led 
to lower profitability among low-wage employers. Instead, we find that 
the costs of the minimum wage were largely passed through to consumers.</div>

 paper resolves issues in the minimum wage-employment debate by using 
factor model econometric methods to address concerns related to 
unobserved heterogeneity. Recent work has shown that the negative 
effects of minimum wages on employment found using traditional methods 
are sensitive to the inclusion of controls for regional heterogeneity 
and selection of states that experience minimum wage hikes, leaving the 
two sides of the debate in disagreement about the appropriate approach. 
Factor model methods are an ideal solution for this disagreement, as 
they allow for the presence of multiple unobserved common factors, which
 can be correlated with the regressors. These methods provide a more 
flexible way of addressing concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity 
and are robust to critiques from either side of the debate. The factor 
model estimators produce minimum wage-employment elasticities that are 
much smaller than the traditional OLS results and are not statistically 
different from zero. These results hold for many specifications and two 
datasets that have been used in the minimum wage-employment literature. A
 simulation shows that unobserved common factors can explain the 
different estimates seen across methodologies in the literature.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11999_abstract">China
 being one of the fastest growing economies, is expected be the source 
of nearly half of the world oil demand growth till 2035. With its policy
 initiatives on renewable energy for transportation, China is currently 
the third largest producer of biofuels in the world next only to Brazil 
and the United States. Biofuels produced from agricultural sources have 
significant potential impact on land, water, and environment. The 
purpose of this study is to assess the impact of China’s biofuels 
production policies on: (i) food supply and food prices, (ii) land and 
water use impacts, (iii) greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. For this 
purpose we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model 
called GDyn-E-BIO model developed based on the Global Trade Analysis 
Project (GTAP) data base which includes explicit agricultural sectors, 
first and second generation biofuels, and land use and land cover 
classified at 18-agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The model includes an 
aggregated data base that comprise 25 global regions and 45 sectors, 
focusing on food and fuel sectors most likely to be directly impacted by
 China’s expanded biofuels production. The GDyn-E-BIO model is a 
multi-region, multi-sector, recursive dynamic CGE model where the agents
 base their decisions on adaptive expectations, with international 
capital mobility and endogenous capital accumulation. The dynamics in 
this model comes from capital accumulation, labor productivity, and 
other exogenous macro variables such as GDP and population growth. In 
addition, our baseline (2004-2050), includes technological change in 
agricultural production. Based on crop-wise land use change from the CGE
 model, we estimate the green (rainwater), blue (surface and 
groundwater), and grey (freshwater pollution) water footprint (WF) 
resulted over the biofuels production chain in China. Our empirical 
results indicate that it is possible to meet the stated mandate without 
substantial impact on food supply or water needs.</div>

 the middle of 2014, the Obama Administration unveiled new environmental
 regulations in order to cut carbon pollution from the Power Sector. 
While some parties applauded the new rules, others criticized them for

In this paper we ask how the new rules will change the generation

We set up and estimate a structural model of the Electricity Sector. The

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11160_abstract">It
 has been suggested in the literature that rising obesity rates 
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions both directly through increased 
food production, and indirectly through higher passenger weights and 
increasing sedentary lifestyles. Using panel data for the fifty US 
states over the period 1997 to 2011 we examine the relationship between 
the obesity rate and carbon dioxide emissions from energy use. Results 
indicate a positive and significant relationship, holding population, 
affluence, sectoral composition, and other factors constant. 
Specifically, we find that reversion to 1997 obesity rates nationwide 
could reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions from energy use by 271 
million metric tons, or approximately five percent of annual US 
emissions. This reduction yields annual climate benefits of between $9.9
 and $15.8 billion using EPA estimates of the social cost of carbon. We 
suggest that policies directed toward obesity reduction have the 
potential to generate significant climate co-benefits alongside the 
well-known health benefits. Therefore, policies aimed at reducing 
transportation related emissions via increased active transport, such as
 walking and bicycling, may achieve both direct climate benefits through
 reduced fuel use and indirect climate benefits via reduced obesity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10888_abstract">This
 paper explores the drivers of emissions intensity improvements for a 
cross-section of countries over the period 1995-2009. It first documents
 the pattern of GHG intensity changes across 40 developed and developing
 countries using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). This database 
accounts for internal and external linkages between countries.  It 
identifies overall GHG emission intensities (tonnes of emissions per 
$GDP) as well as decomposing this into structural intensities and 
technological intensities.  Since the countries in the dataset are large
 importers and exporters, the paper looks at both Production-based 
intensities as well as Demand-based intensities.  The Demand-based 
intensities takes into account the net emissions from final consumption 
of domestic and imported goods, as such it excludes emissions from 
production of exports from domestic emissions and includes those 
resulted from production of imports.

The paper then regress these intensities against plausible drivers using
 the cross-section of countries.  It includes energy prices; capital and
 labour inputs; reliance on renewable energy; investment and R&amp;D 
rates; overall level of development, population density, urbanization, 
and trade openness; and policy-relevant variables. The paper finds that 
drivers for Production-based intensities differ somewhat from 
Demand-based intensities but do so in plausible ways.  Similarly, the 
drivers of structural intensities differ somewhat from the drivers of 
technological intensities.  In general, the paper finds that higher 
energy prices are correlated with decreasing intensities as does higher 
capital-labour ratios and investment-R&amp;D rates.  Some richer 
countries have higher intensities as do more densely populated ones.  
Reliance on non-renewables is not correlated with any measure of 
intensity.</div>

 of January 2012, 29 U.S. states and the District of Columbia had 
enacted a Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or other mandated 
renewable energy policy. RPS require that electricity producers supply a
 portion of their electricity from designated renewable resources by a 
specified future date. The adoption of RPS is motivated by a complex set
 of political and economic factors, including increasing concerns over 
climate change and energy security. We examine whether RPS is having the
 intended effect of increasing renewable electricity generation 
capacity. Several papers have used panel data analyses to examine the 
effectiveness of U.S. state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) in
 promoting the development of renewable generation capacity, but the 
empirical literature has generally failed to find conclusive evidence of
 an average treatment effect of RPS on renewables adoption across RPS 
states. This highlights the need for analyses that accommodate the 
possibility of treatment heterogeneity, particularly because RPS are 
unique state-level policies. RPS vary in the amount of electricity 
generation that must be supplied from renewables, the types of allowable
 renewables, the year of required implementation of the final mandate, 
and the magnitude and the timing of intermediate mandates. RPS states 
also differ in the nature of the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) trading 
markets, and the degree and scope of restructuring requirements. 
Estimation of average treatment effects can mask the fact that RPS 
policies across states are disparate and the treatment states are 
heterogeneous. We use the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) in order to 
conduct individual case studies of the early adopter states, states that
 enacted RPS between 1997 and 2000. Our findings indicate that the 
impact of RPS varied across states. We find Texas to be unique among 
these early adopters in that RPS in Texas has led to increased renewable
 capacity.</div>

 explore the first period of decline in infant mortality in the U.S. and
 provide estimates of the independent and combined effects of clean 
water and effective sewerage systems on infant mortality. Our case is 
Massachusetts, 1880-1915, when state authorities developed a sewerage 
and water district for municipalities in the Boston Greater Metropolitan
 area. We find that the two interventions were complementary and 
together accounted for approximately 35 percent of the total decline in 
log infant mortality among treated municipalities during the 35 years 
considered. Considerable research has documented the importance of clean
 water interventions for improvement in population health, but there is 
less evidence on the importance of sewerage systems. Our findings are 
directly relevant to urbanization in the developing world and suggest 
that a dual-pronged approach of safe water and sewerage is important to 
improving
infant and early child survival.</div>

places to live. Most existing work has linked this pattern to the spread of
infectious diseases in crowded urban environments or to nutritional factors.
This study highlights a third important factor: pollution. Combining detailed
mortality data for over 500 districts covering nearly all of England outside of
London with pollution measures based on districts’ industrial composition, I
provide evidence that industrial pollution had an important effect on mortality
in the second half of the 19th century. The estimated effects of pollution on
mortality are substantial; in 1851-1860, pollution increased mortality by 5-7%.
This effect was one-half to two-thirds as large as the impact of all other factors
related to population density, including infectious disease. From 1851-1900,
increasing pollution due to growing industry raised mortality by 1.35-1.46 per
thousand, eliminating 23-25% of the mortality reduction achieved over this
period. I provide evidence that pollution worked through the cause-of-death
channels we would expect, particularly respiratory diseases, but I also show
that pollution interacted with infectious diseases of the respiratory system, such
as tuberculosis and measles, to increase overall mortality. I find that pollution
affected both the young and old, and that the effects spilled over from industrial
areas onto downwind districts</div>

 Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban 
North entailed a significant change in the health environment, 
particularly of infants, during a time when access to medical care and 
public health infrastructure became increasingly important. We create a 
new dataset that links individual infant death certificates to parental 
characteristics to assess the impact of parents' migration to Northern 
cities on infant mortality. The new dataset allows the paper’s key 
innovation, which is to control for selection into migration and 
detailed parental characteristics. Conditional on parents' pre-migration
 observable characteristics and county-of-origin fixed effects, we find 
that black infants were more likely to die in the North relative to 
their southern-born counterparts. We find no evidence of the "healthy

 studies have documented health disparities between blacks and whites in
 the United States. This research study seeks to understand the role of 
mistrust in the healthcare system as a potential cause of historical and
 contemporaneous disparities. Because mistrust is difficult to observe, 
we use a historic episode as a proxy. The Tuskegee (Alabama) Study of 
Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male passively followed black males with
 syphilis between 1932 and 1972 and failed to provide treatment, despite
 the fact that the men in the study believed they were receiving free 
medical care. The deception was disclosed by Jean Heller of the 
Associated Press in 1972 (Jones, 1993). We hypothesize that the Tuskegee
 incident led to increases in mistrust among blacks and, in turn, racial
 disparities in both health seeking behavior and, ultimately, health 
outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we measure whether black men who were
 more likely to be exposed to the news of the study, either due to 
spatial proximity to Tuskegee or to the distribution of media coverage 
of the story, had a larger change in their health seeking behavior and 
health outcomes following the 1972 disclosure.</div>

 study evaluates the effect of medical expenditure risk on the portfolio
 allocation decisions of elderly households. Given the increasing 
prevalence of chronic illnesses with advanced age and rising health care
 costs, older adults face considerable uncertainty regarding their 
future medical expenditures.  Although health insurance coverage can 
mitigate medical spending risk, this risk is typically not fully 
insurable due to deductibles, co-payments and other cost-sharing 
mechanisms. Thus, medical expenditures can be viewed as a type of 
un-diversifiable background risk. Economic theory suggests that 
background risk influences the amount of financial risk that a household
 is willing to bear, i.e. it influences portfolio choice. A key 
challenge in estimating the causal impact of medical spending risk on 
portfolio choice, however, is that unobserved factors simultaneously 
affect both medical spending and investment decisions. In this study, we
 exploit the exogenous reduction in prescription drug spending risk due 
to the 2006 introduction of the Medicare Part D program to identify 
causal effects. Using data from the 1996-2010 waves of the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS), we estimate the impact of Medicare Part D on the
 probability of owning risky assets (e.g., stocks, mutual funds and 
investment trusts), and on the share of financial wealth invested in 
risky assets. We find a significant increase in both ownership of risky 
assets and share of financial wealth in risky assets in response to the 
reduction in medical expenditure risk due to Medicare Part D. We also 
find evidence of heterogeneity – households in the middle of the wealth 
distribution are more responsive to the drop in spending risk, as are 
persons with better cognitive ability, longer planning horizons, and 
stronger bequest motives. We discuss the implications of our results for
 health insurance policy and for the financial security and welfare of 
elderly households.</div>

 longstanding literature has highlighted the tension between the 
altruism of physicians and their desire for profit.  This paper develops
 new implications for how these forces drive pricing and utilization 
outcomes in healthcare markets. Altruism dictates that providers reduce 
utilization in response to higher prices, but profit-maximization does 
the opposite.  Rational physicians will behave more altruistically 
towards poorer, vulnerable patients, and when the financial costs of 
altruism are lower.  These insights help explain the observed 
heterogeneity in pricing dynamics across different healthcare markets. 
We empirically test the implications of our model by utilizing two 
exogenous shocks in Medicare price setting policies.  Our results

cost-sharing may not generate the intended responses on quantity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14484_abstract">To
 answer whether public pensions displace private household saving, we 
study a pension reform in Poland that created a setting similar to a 
quasi-experiment. Poland's 1999 pension reform had a different impact on
 individuals depending on their year of birth. Individuals who were 
older than 50 years at the time of the reform were not directly affected
 by the reform. However, individuals who were 50 years or younger at the
 time of the reform will receive pension benefits computed according to a
 much less generous post-reform pension formula. We use this 
arbitrarily-set cutoff at age 50 to identify whether the resulting 
decrease in expected pension wealth led to an increase in household 
saving, or, equivalently, to answer whether public pensions crowd out 
household saving.  By comparing the saving rate before and after the 
reform and across similarly aged people—some of whom were affected by 
the reform and some of whom were not—we can identify the effect of the 
reform on this outcome. To do so, we use data from the Polish Household 
Budget Surveys for the years 1997–2003 to first estimate 
difference-in-differences regressions comparing household saving rate 
before and after the 1999 reform for the cohorts directly affected and 
unaffected by the reform. Second, we estimate the degree of crowd-out, 
i.e., the change in the household saving rate in response to the change 
in expected public pension wealth exogenously induced by the reform.  We
 estimate that, for cohorts closest in age to the unaffected control 
group, public pensions displace private saving by approximately one for 
one. This key result means that, for older households, public pensions 
and private saving are close to perfect substitutes.</div>

 paper is the first to empirically investigate the spillover effects of 
two-rate property taxation in Pennsylvania. Using rich panel data for 
county subdivisions in Pennsylvania over the period 1980-2010, this 
paper extends the existing research by offering the first evidence on 
the external impacts of two-rate property taxation as well as the 
spatial dynamics of these spillover effects. The empirical model 
separately identifies the externalities associated with two-rate 
property taxation as well as the external impacts of traditional 
property taxation. The study shows that two-rate property taxation slows
 down employment growth in close neighbors but speeds up employment 
growth in neighbors within a longer distance. The findings suggest that 
two-rate property taxation generates differential spillover effects 
across space.</div>

 paper comprehensively examines the effect of the EITC on the employment
 and income of single mothers with children. We provide the first 
comprehensive estimates of this central safety net policy on the full 
distribution of after-tax and transfer income. We use a 
quasi-experimental approach, using variation in generosity due to policy
 expansions across tax years and family sizes. Our results show that a 
policy-induced $1000 increase in the EITC leads to a 7.2 to 8.2 
percentage point increase in employment and a 5.4 to 9.4 percentage 
point reduction in the share of families with after-tax and transfer 
income below 100% poverty. These results are robust to a rich set of 
controls and to whether we limit our analysis to the sharp increase in 
EITC due to the 1993 expansion or use the full period of policy 
expansion, back to the 1986 Tax Reform Act. We find that the income 
increasing effects of the EITC are concentrated between 75% and 150% of 
poverty with little effect at the lowest income levels (50% poverty and 
below) and at levels of 250% of poverty and higher.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13039_abstract">This
 paper aims to shed light on the relation between ownership structure 
and capital structure choices of private firms, and how this relation is
 affected by dividend taxation. We use comprehensive administrative tax 
panel data from Norway on all corporations to answer a puzzle raised by 
Brav (2009) regarding the differences in capital structure between 
private and public firms. We also have information on the debt 
composition to distinguish insider debt, bank loans, and bonds. With 
this administrative data, we can additionally link ownership information
 and individual income tax information of each (domestic) owner to the 
firm data to obtain the each firm’s ownership structure. We proceed by 
examining three unanswered questions in the literature. First, how does 
ownership concentration relate to financial policies of private firms? 
Second, how does ownership affect debt composition? Third, how does 
ownership concentration relate to the cost of debt? In the second part 
of our empirical analysis, we examine the effect of dividend taxation on
 capital structure around a 2006 Norwegian tax reform that introduced a 
28% dividend tax rate. Since such a tax increase raises the cost of 
(external) equity and, consequently, changes the relative cost of debt 
vis-à-vis equity, we would expect that dividend taxation is a potential 
determinant of capital structure. To this end, we test empirically how 
capital structure of private firms changes around the Norwegian tax 
reform and how this response is driven by the ownership structure.</div>

 study examines the extent to which targeted property tax relief is 
capitalized into home prices, which is critical for understanding 
exactly who benefits from this policy. Specifically, we investigate this
 in the context of two state-wide ballot measures in Virginia that 
provided property tax relief intended to aid the elderly and disabled 
veterans respectively. Using residential MLS microdata from Virginia, 
results from a regression discontinuity analysis show that once the 2010
 tax relief measures passed on Election Day, property values rose 
sharply in response to the sudden increase in demand of homeownership 
among the targeted groups. As part of our identification strategy, we 
find that “senior preferred” housing as well as areas with higher 
proportions of seniors and veterans experienced the highest price 
appreciation, while areas with fewer veterans or seniors saw little 
impact. Further, we explore numerous alternative hypotheses and 
specifications that might explain this discontinuity. Our findings 
indicate that the 2010 tax relief measures were largely capitalized into
 home prices just after the election, benefiting current homeowners in 
certain sub-markets. This represents a critical unintended consequence 
of targeted property tax relief as a (very popular) policy tool more 
generally, as full capitalization into home prices increases the cost of
 housing for many individuals the relief was intended to help.</div>

 significant interest in corporate culture, there is little empirical 
research on its role in influencing opportunistic behavior. Using 
cultural background information on key company insiders and the idea 
that immigrants can bring cultural attitudes from their native countries
 to the U.S., I construct a measure of a firm's corruption culture, 
capturing the firm’s general attitude toward opportunistic behavior. For
 a sample of around 8,000 public firms in the U.S., I find that firms 
with high corruption culture are more likely to engage in earnings 
management, accounting fraud, option backdating, and opportunistic 
insider trading. I further explore how corruption culture impacts 
corporate misconduct and find evidence that it operates by acting as a 
selection mechanism and by having a direct influence on individual 
behavior beyond individual personal attitudes. In addition, I study the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10024_abstract">Koopman,
 Wang and Wei (AER, 2014) and Wang, Wei and Zhu (NBER Working Paper, 
2013) have presented a complete gross trade flow accounting framework at
 any level of dis-aggregation. While the accounting exercises conducted 
in the two papers provide useful new measures of production sharing and 
cross border trade, as well as identify what is double counted in the 
official trade data, the determinants and consequences of production 
sharing and these double counted components are not addressed. In this 
paper, we will conduct economic analysis by combining the decomposition 
obtained from those accounting exercises with an economic theoretical 
model.
The first step in this direction is to develop indexes that can measure a
 country/industry’s position and participation in GVCs and systemically 
ranking all country/industry pairs available in these ICIO tables from 
the WIOD, OECD, GTAP, and Eora databases and econometrically study the 
determinate of these indexes over time guided by theoretical models. 
There are three major related tasks that need to be solved: (1) we 
construct GVC position indexes based on value-added measures that is 
stable regardless of industry classifications; construct GVC 
participation indexes to measure the degree of participation by each 
country in a particular manufacturing GVC. (2) based on theoretical 
literature and data, we analyze the determinate of each country’s 
position and participation in GVCs and what role a country’s GVC 
position and participation plays in its economic growth, productivity, 
and development. (3) Finally, we explore policy implications of our 
findings. we explore policy implications of our findings. For example, 
China and India participate in GVCs in different ways. What roles do 
these differences play in their economic development and integration to 
the world economy?We find that the relative ranking of production length
 at the sector level is relatively stable across countries. However, the
 average production length for a given country, and a country’s 
participation in GVCs, in general, do evolve significantly over time. 
The results contribute to a better understanding of "upstreamness" of a 
country–sector's participation in international value chains. We also 
use the results to re-define and re-compute a country's "revealed 
comparative advantage" that takes into account offshoring and 
outsourcing features.</div>

 polarization is the shift of employment and earnings from mid-level 
wage jobs to both high- and low-wage jobs. Employing longitudinal 
employee-employer matched data on all workers and firms in Denmark we 
investigate the role of international trade for job polarization as 
Danish workers faced intense import competition from China over the 
period 1999 to 2009. Using an instrumental variables approach we show 
that import competition from China is an important cause of job 
polarization in Denmark, about four times the size of the effect of 
offshoring. We confirm a strong role for technical change and 
computerization for polarization, although these factors cannot explain 
the rise in low-wage employment by the early 2000s. The removal of 
restrictions on textile exports with China’s entry in the World Trade 
Organization provides a quasi-experimental setting that shows our 
instrumental variables approach captures the substance of trade’s causal
 effect on job polarization.  Import competition leads to job 
polarization by shifting workers from initially abundant manufacturing 
jobs to both high- and low-paying services jobs. Low-educated workers 
lose mid-level jobs, and move into low-wage jobs to a greater extent 
that more educated workers. Finally, when exposed to import competition 
women transition less well than men into high-wage jobs.</div>

 analyze the impact of a low-wage trade shock on manufacturing workers 
in a high-wage country, Denmark, and how they adjust to the shock over a
 decade across all potential adjustment margins, in the labor market and
 outside. My research illustrates the importance of industry-specific 
human capital in trade adjustment and provides initial evidence of skill
 upgrading at the individual level as workers re-build lost human 
capital through education.
Employing administrative person-level panel data matched with employer 
data for the period 1999 to 2010, I exploit the dismantling of import 
quotas on Chinese textile and clothing products in conjunction with 
China's accession to the WTO as a quasi-natural experiment and utilize 
within-industry heterogeneity in workers' exposure to this trade shock. 
Results show a negative and significant impact of the low-wage import 
shock on workers' future earnings and employment trajectories, which 
stems mainly from shortened employment at the firm that was exposed to 
the competition shock and subsequent difficulty in maintaining stable 
employment. While the service sector is the main absorber of all types 
of workers displaced by the import shock, recovery from the shock in 
service sector jobs varies greatly across workers depending on 
occupation, education and age. Less-educated, older and workers who had 
occupations with a high industry-specific skill content at the exposed 
firms had the worst adjustment experience. The results show that 
trade-induced adjustment costs are substantial and heterogeneous across 
workers. For some, challenges remain even after transitioning to 
full-time jobs outside of manufacturing, as the loss of human capital 
specific to their former industry remains as an important hurdle to 
recovery.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11835_abstract">This
 paper develops a novel theory of firm dynamics within a Ricardian model
 of trade, and show that this theory can explain the international 
elasticity puzzle as well as large and persistent deviations from the 
law of one price. Firms differ in idiosyncratic  labor productivity and 
endogenous mass of customers. A higher mass of customers is associated 
to persistently higher demand as search frictions prevent customers from
 freely moving across suppliers. Firms compete for customers through 
prices: a lower price increases the chances of retaining customers. 


As the same firm faces different degree of competition in different 
markets, firms charge different prices in different markets. Exporters 
face sunk costs and iceberg costs to serve the foreign  market.  
International trade dynamics in this framework depend on the dynamics of
 two district components: an extensive margin associated to the mass of 
firms exporting, and an intensive margin associated to the quantity 
exported by each exporter. The mass of customers of the different 
exporters, and its dynamics,  is key to determine the contribution of 
each margin to international trade dynamics. 

While the existing literature has focused on these channels in 
isolation, this paper proposes a unified framework and uses it to 
quantify the contribution of each of them to explain international trade
 dynamics. Moreover, the tight link between the variability in product 
level real exchange rate and the relevance of customer dynamics for 
firms pricing, together with micro evidence on  international relative 
price dynamics,  provides a disciplining device to assess the relevance 
of the extensive and intensive margins of trade to explain trade 
dynamics.</div>

 examine the effect of higher wages on firm performance during the 2008 
financial crisis. Our sample includes UK firms which signed long-term 
wage agreements with their employees before September 2008, thereby 
giving pay raises. Firms covered by binding agreements which extend deep
 in the crisis paid higher wages but also realized greater ex-post 
performance measured by sales, sales per employee, profits and market 
shares, as compared to control firms with agreements overlapping 
modestly with the crisis. Several robustness tests, including an IV

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21057_abstract">In
 this paper, we investigate the impact of workers’ unemployment risk, a 
salient attribute of labor market frictions, on the design of CEO 
incentive compensation. Exploiting state-level changes in unemployment 
insurance benefits as a source of variation in the unemployment costs 
faced by workers, we find that, after unemployment insurance benefits 
increase, boards adjust the compensation structure and provide managers 
with more stock option grants that result in more convexity payoffs. 
Such a change is consistent with the view that CEO’s risk-taking 
incentives are amplified to take advantage of lower unemployment costs. 
The increase in convexity payoff structures is more pronounced in 
labor-intensive industries and industries that have higher layoff 
propensity, but is significantly attenuated when strong labor unions are
 present. The results are also stronger when the human capital of the 
CEO is more closely tied to the firm or when the CEO is older. Finally, 
we show that the increase in convexity payoff from option-based 
compensation induces firms to undertake more risky investments that 
deliver improved operating performance after the increase in 
unemployment insurance benefits. These results suggest that firms 
respond to unemployment risk by changing their risk taking behavior, and
 one channel through which they do so is executive compensation.</div>

 empirical literature on executive compensation often models unobserved 
managerial attributes as time-invariant fixed effects. The labor market 
for executives, however, may value these attributes differently over 
time. We propose and estimate an interactive fixed effects (IFE) model 
of executive compensation. The IFE model allows for time variation in 
the market valuation of unobserved managerial attributes. The model can 
also incorporate multiple managerial fixed effects. We find that two 
managerial attributes are economically important in explaining executive
 pay. The first one captures general managerial talent, and the second 
appears to capture managerial optimism, risk tolerance, and specific 
human capital. The results show that the market prices of these 
attributes have substantial time variations. Finally, the IFE model can 
estimate the coefficients on time-constant variables, while standard 
fixed effect model cannot because such variables are absorbed in the 
fixed effects. The IFE model proposed in the paper may have potential 
applications in other areas in economics and finance.</div>

 Performance Evaluation (RPE) theory predicts that firms filter out 
common shocks (i.e., those affecting the firm and its peers) while 
evaluating CEO performance, and that the extent of filtering increases 
with the number of firms in the peer group. Despite the intuitive appeal
 of the theory, previous tests of RPE find weak and inconsistent 
evidence. We hypothesize that one reason for the mixed evidence is the 
inaccurate classification of peers. Rather than using static, 
pre-defined Standard Industry Classifications (SIC), we exploit recent 
advances in textual analysis and define peers based on firms’ product 
descriptions in their 10-K filings (e.g., Hoberg and Phillips, 2015). 
This alternative classification not only captures common shocks to 
firms’ product markets more effectively, but also tracks the evolving 
nature of these markets, as 10-Ks are updated annually. Using product 
market peers, we find three pieces of evidence consistent with RPE – (i)
 firms on average filter out common shocks to performance measures, (ii)
 the extent of filtering increases with the number of peers, and (iii) 
firms completely filter out common shocks in the presence of a large 
number of peers. We are able to replicate the first finding but not the 
other two using pre-defined industry classifications. Overall, our 
results suggest that a key identification strategy to testing RPE theory
 lies in accurately defining the peer group.</div>

 to high-yield bond mutual fund outflows. This effect is con- centrated 
in periods of large fund outflows and among financially constrained

Further analysis suggests that the market’s reaction to earnings quality
 comments is primarily driven by comments written with certainty. In 
addition, firms with earnings quality that is criticized by analysts 
exhibit a higher level of accruals-based earnings management than 
non-criticized firms. Controlling for accrual reversals, I find that

 a comprehensive employer-employee dataset from German social security 
records, we ex- amine the impact of an exogenous shock to bank capital 
on firms’ employment and investment decisions, and on individual 
workers’ careers. We find that German regional banks’ trading losses 
from U.S. mortgage-backed securities cause a deep economic contraction 
in the banks’ exclusive geographic domains. Loan growth and output 
growth decline by 20 and 0.6 percentage points per crisis year, 
respectively, and the unemployment rate rises by 1.4 percentage points 
during each year of the crisis in affected states compared to unaffected
 states. The effect is stronger for privately held, bank-dependent firms
 than for publicly listed firms: private firms in affected states reduce
 net hiring by 24 percentage points and cut investment by one-half 
compared to publicly listed firms. We then study how firms’ access to 
bank credit affects individuals’ wages, unemployment dura- tion, and 
occupational choices. Workers in affected firms experience persistent 
earnings losses of approximately 1,000 Euro per year, nine weeks longer 
unemployment spells, and a lower probability of climbing the job ladder

 pay in the financial sector has experienced an extraordinary increase

been that demand for skilled workers in finance has increased more than 
in other sectors. We exploit Swedish administrative data, which include 
detailed cognitive and non-cognitive test scores for individuals, to 
examine the implications of this hypothesis for talent allocation and 
relative wages in the financial sector. We find no evidence that the 
selection of talent into finance increased or improved, neither on 
average nor at the top of the talent distribution. Finance does not 
become more skill-biased and changing composition of skills or their 
returns cannot account for the surge in the finance wage premium. These 
findings alleviate concerns about a “brain drain” into finance at the 
expense of other sectors, but they also suggest that rents in finance 
are high, increasing, and largely unexplained.&lt;br /&gt;

 corporate finance studies show that hedging is a first-order driver of

 framework in which collateral constraints induce a tradeoff between 
hedging and immediate needs for funding. Firms hedge by transferring 
resources to future states that are most important for firm’s value. In 
the model, firms’ hedging behavior is informative of the shareholders’ 
stochastic discount factor, which measures the value of each state. As a
 consequence, discount rates can be inferred from firm’s observed 
investment, financing, and hedging policies. On the corporate finance 
side, a calibrated version of the model is broadly consistent with 
observed corporate policies of US listed firms. On the asset pricing 
side, the Corporate CAPM is successful in pricing different test assets,

asymmetries between investors and the issuing firm are likely to be 
high. Consistent with the important role of informed investors in the 
price discovery process, we find that EDGAR search traffic significantly
 increases for peer firms on IPO filing dates. We also find that 
investor demand for information is positively related to the probability
 of IPO success, and can predict both price revisions and initial 
returns. Overall, our results indicate that information acquisition is 
reflected in the pricing of newly issued securities.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21301_abstract">In
 analyzing regulatory experiments, a fundamental assumption is that the 
control group is unaffected.  However, in many settings, this assumption
 may not hold.  Generally, the total effect of a regulatory change 
consists of direct and indirect effects, but the standard 
difference-in-difference approach measures only direct effects.  We 
apply our methods to the 2007 repeal of the uptick rule by the SEC.  The
 indirect effects are substantial, because unlike the 2005 partial 
repeal, total repeal enabled aggressive portfolio shorting.  The 2007 
repeal causes increased price efficiency and slightly worse liquidity.  
We conclude that regulatory pilot designers should carefully consider 
potential spillovers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20974_abstract">Using
 data from a unique episode in which the SEC disseminated securities 
filings to a small group of private investors before releasing them to 
the public, we provide a direct test of the process through which 
private information is impounded into stock prices. Because the delay 
between the time when the filings were privately distributed and when 
the filings were made public was randomly distributed, our setting 
provides a rare natural experiment for examining how markets process new
 private information. We find that it takes minutes—not seconds—for 
informed traders to incorporate fundamental information into stock 
prices. We also show that the private investors who had early access to 
fundamental information profited more, and convey more information into 
stock prices, when the delay before the filings are released to the 
public is longer. More importantly, the rate at which information is 
impounded into stock prices is more correlated with the length of the 
predicted delay before public release than the actual delay, suggesting 
that informed investors trade strategically. Our study serves as the 
modern counterpart to Koudijs’s (2014a) study on insider trading on 
eighteenth-century stock exchanges—except, in our case, week-long 
sailing voyages have been replaced by modern electronic transmission as 
the conduit for information flows. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21415_abstract">Using
 a unique sample of unscheduled disclosures of material corporate events
 constructed from over 500,000 8-K filings, we find significant 
heterogeneity in the timeliness of information disclosure, both across 
and within firms. We demonstrate that this timing dimension of 
information structure has first-order effects on information asymmetry 
and stock prices. Taking 10 more business days to disclose is associated
 with an average filing period bid-ask spread ranging from 13.78% to 
34.31% wider, compared to an immediate disclosure. Contrary to 
predictions in existing models, the effect of timeliness on stock 
returns varies by the type of the event. For good news, longer 
disclosure lags is associated with significantly lower abnormal returns 
during the filing period, whereas bad news exhibit the opposite 
relation. Furthermore, we find evidence consistent with firms 
strategically choosing the level of disclosure timeliness according to 
the type and business category of the event. </div>

 examine patterns of option trading activity around news announcements. 
Combining a database of option volume by trade type with a database of 
news releases, we find that option trading activity is unu-sually high 
both immediately before news days and on news days. As option volume on 
both days is a stronger predictor of future stock returns than option 
volume on other days, the trading advantage of in-formed option traders 
stems from their ability to analyze publicly available information as 
well as anticipate upcoming news events. Our main contribution is to 
show that where informed option traders trade depends on whether news 
releases are anticipated. We show theoretically that, when no news is 
scheduled to be released, informed traders prefer long option positions 
to short option positions and that the opposite is true ahead of 
scheduled news releases. Consistent with this, we find that purchases of
 options predict returns on news days and ahead of unscheduled events, 
but not before scheduled events, and sales of options are informative 
only ahead of scheduled news releases.</div>

Excess returns from portfolios of simple trading strategies do not

 partners of private equity funds commit capital with extreme 
restrictions on liquidity and a large degree of uncertainty regarding 
the timing of capital calls and payoffs. Secondary markets have emerged 
which alleviate some of the associated cost of illiquidity. This paper 
develops a subjective valuation model that incorporates these 
institutional features. We find that for a risk-averse limited partner 
the value of a private equity investment is highly sensitive to the 
time-varying discount observed in secondary market transactions. 
Model-implied breakeven returns required to compensate the limited 
partner for liquidity costs, market risk, and fees of investing in 
private equity funds generally exceed empirically observed returns. Only
 for highly risk-tolerant LPs facing an efficient secondary market and 
able to access above-average funds are the costs of private equity 
justified by performance. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20030_abstract">We study the interim performance of private equity (PE) funds around the time of
fundraising events using fund level cash flow and valuation data for over 800 funds
raised between 1993 and 2009. We first show that interim performance, measured as the
current fund’s percentile rank relative to its vintage year cohort funds, materially affects
the PE firm’s ability to raise a follow-on fund and the size of the follow-on fund. Given
these incentive results, we hypothesize and find that PE firms time their fundraising
activities to coincide with periods when the current fund’s interim performance is at its
peak relative to its vintage year cohorts. We further document that the size and frequency
of net asset value (NAV) markdowns increases in the period following fundraising,
which suggests that fund valuations are inflated during the fundraising period. Consistent
with this interpretation, we find the size and frequency of markdowns increases most for
small, young, and low-reputation PE firms, which have the clearest incentives to report
strong interim performance. For buyout funds, we also find evidence of post-fundraising
performance erosion (due to NAV inflation during fundraising) but only among the
small, young, and low-reputation PE firms. Our results indicate that PE firms, particularly
small, young, and low-reputation firms, are good at timing their fundraising activities to
coincide with periods of peak performance and are reluctant to mark down the valuations
of portfolio companies during fundraising periods.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13755_abstract">Because
 of hukou registration system, people in China lost the freedom of 
migration. This paper focuses on one of the formal channels to migrate 
to cities: zhaosheng. To better capture the reality, we also consider 
the migration of rural workers, or nongmingong, to cities. A general 
equilibrium model with endogenous education migration decision is 
employed. The framework is calibrated to data from China and then 
counterfactual experiments are conducted. In particular, the abolishment
 of government job assignment for college graduates in 1994 is examined 
in this paper. We find that if rural-urban migration is completely 
debarred, urban output would be 15.89 percent lower than that in the 
benchmark model and total output would be 7.75 percent lower during 
1981-2007. We also find a complementarity between college graduates and 
nongmingong in production and migration via zhaosheng contributes to 
more of the increase in total output. Our counterfactual experiments 
indicate that (1) If the policy of government job assignment had been 
continued, total output would only increase by 0.72 percent during 
1995-2007; (2) If China had adopted a more relaxing policy on rural 
migrant workers, total output would increase by 2.58 percent in 
1981-2007; (3) If China had not loosened its control on rural migrant 
workers in the 1990s, total output would decrease by 1.51 percent in 
1995-2007; (4) If the technology in urban production is improved by 5 
percent, urban output would increase by 1.91 percent throughout 
1981-2007.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13756_abstract">During
 the rapid urbanization in recent years, local governments in China 
constantly sell land leases to independent developers. The long-term 
land leaseholds always contain some floor-area-ratio restrictions, which
 specify the maximum allowed ratio of a building's total floor area to 
the size of the land upon which it is to be built. In this study, we 
seek to understand how floor-area-ratio restrictions affect urban land 
value and how such restrictions vary across locations and over time. Our
 model implies that government imposed floor-area-ratio restrictions are
 binding; relaxation of the restriction increases land value; and the 
elasticity of land value with respect to changes in the imposed floor 
area ratio reflects the restrictiveness of the limit. We draw 
information from two unique data sets to perform empirical analysis: One
 contains information on over 120,000 land transactions in more than 200
 Chinese cities during 2002-2011 and the other covers land parcels in 
Beijing for which government officials revised the planned floor area 
ratios in response to changes in local conditions between 1999 and 2006.
 We find that higher allowed floor area ratios lead to higher land 
prices, this effect varies a lot across cities, and planned floor area 
ratios tend to be adjusted upward for land parcels closer to newly 
constructed infrastructure, all consistent with the predictions of our 
model.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13757_abstract">Since
 over the past decade, China's housing market has seen a remarkable 
transition, particular runup in land and house prices. Using an 
innovative panel data set of 35 major cities in China from 2000 to 2011,
 we examine alternative housing price models focusing on the price 
elasticity of supply of housing, and its determinants. We develop a 
two-stage model to estimate supply elasticity for each city using an 
equilibrium model of supply and demand in the first stage and to 
estimate the determinants of supply elasticity with a cross-section of 
city data in the second stage. To further our investigation of the 
supply elasticity in China, we have constructed several indexes of the 
regulatory environment in each of our 35 cities with a new real estate 
regulations dataset, as well as a new measure of topographical 
constraints. In addition to the regulatory variables, we examine the 
effects of geography, environmental infrastructure, density, and the 
level and growth rate of population. Our findings demonstrate that, 
consistent with literature, the national supply elasticity falls in the 
range of 0.31 to 2.12 under various parameter assumptions. The city 
level supply elasticity varies according to their economic and real 
estate development. Mountain area has a negative impact on supply 
elasticity. Regulatory environment negatively affects housing supply 
elasticity; consistent with the literature that strictly regulatory 
environment restricts the supply elasticity in a local market. Index of 
environment infrastructure positively affects housing supply elasticity.
 Population size and growth rate negatively affect housing supply 
elasticity.</div>

 intertwining of local Chinese housing markets with government fiscal 
policies coincides with the significant economic growth in China over 
the past 25-years. This connection is the direct result of China’s 
central government reforms to its fiscal system that have encouraged 
local governments to rely on land sales and development to fund required
 infrastructure projects. Since China does not allow local governments 
to directly participate in the municipal bond market, these governments 
rely on a unique funding mechanism known as Local Government-Backed 
Investment Units (LGBIU). We study the linkage between the solvency of 
local government debt and local housing market risk. Our results 
indicate that areas with higher expected house price growth issue debt 
with lower risk premiums. Furthermore, bonds issued by LGBIUs from areas
 that experience greater changes in housing prices have a corresponding 
decline in observed yield spreads. Thus, the results suggest that 
investors do price local housing risk into Chinese municipal bond risk 
premiums.</div>

 investigate the role of divorce as a risk factor that affects household
 consumption and housing decisions in a realistically calibrated 
life-cycle model. Divorces result in a reduction of household net worth,
 and therefore reduce the likelihood of being a homeowner. The reduction
 in homeownership lasts for decades, even though households can remarry 
later. Welfare costs from getting divorced can exceed 20% of lifetime 
consumption at the age of 30, and more than double by the age of 60. The
 risk of divorce leads to precautionary savings, facilitates earlier 
homeownership, and has welfare implications even for individuals not 
getting divorced.</div>

 possibility that local consumption amenities provided by bars, 
restaurants, and other retail services improve neighborhood or city 
attractiveness has received increasing attention in the literature. 
Empirical research thus far has focused on the number of establishments 
in an area. This paper proposes and tests a method for differentiating 
consumption amenities along a quality dimension, based on either 
consumer ratings or price estimates from Yelp.com. Appealing to the 
implicit market model of Rosen (1974), consumption amenity is 
capitalized in the value of nearby housing. The results demonstrate that
 both the quantity and quality aspects of consumption amenities matter, 
and that consumer ratings are more informative about unobservable 
restaurant amenity than price estimates. Furthermore, comparisons 
between the results for the pre- and post-Yelp periods show that 
provision of information on restaurant amenity over Yelp has an added 
effect on capitalization. The method used in this paper to measure the 
quality of consumption amenities could be applied to other private 
retail businesses or even local public goods.</div>

 share of high-skilled workers in U.S. cities is positively correlated 
with city size, and this correlation strengthened between 1980 and 2010.
 Furthermore, during the same time period, the U.S. economy experienced a
 significant structural transformation with regard to industrial 
composition, most notably in the decline of manufacturing and the rise 
of high-skilled service industries. To decompose and investigate these 
trends, this paper develops and estimates a spatial equilibrium model 
with heterogeneous firms and workers that allows for both 
industry-specific and skill-specific technology changes across cities. 
The estimates imply that both supply and demand of high-skilled labor 
have increased over time in big cities. In addition, demand for skilled 
labor in large cities has increased somewhat within all industries. 
However, the aggregate skill demand in cities is disproportionately 
concentrated in a few industries. For example, the finance, insurance, 
and real estate sectors alone account for 38 percent of the population 
elasticity of skilled labor demand in 2010 and 30 percent of the net 
change in demand elasticity over time.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13847_abstract">The
 biggest decline in global trade costs since the advent of the railroad 
is premised on a simple insight: packaging goods into a standardized 
container makes them cheaper to ship. Containerization has eased the 
transfer from ship to train to truck and facilitated the national and 
international transport of goods. We ask how this reshaping of global 
trade has redistributed economic activity, both across and within 
cities. We contend with the non-random adoption of containerization by 
employing a novel instrument: being a very deep port in 1953, before 
containerization. Before containerization, although being a somewhat 
deep port was useful, being a very deep port was not additionally 
useful. After containerization, being a deep port became a distinct 
advantage, because container ships were much larger and had a lower 
draft than their predecessors. Analogous to a supply shifter, port depth
 should affect the supply of ports, but have no effect on the demand for
 ports. We use data from the U.S. County Business Patterns for 1956 and 
1967-2011, and our preliminary results suggest that initially (1953) 
deeper ports were indeed likely to containerize earlier. In addition, we
 find a significant impact of containerization on jobs, particularly in 
the manufacturing sector, as manufactured goods ship primarily in 
containers. Manufacturing employment increased by 12 percent more in 
containerized counties than in the rest of the country, and by almost 20
 percent more than in other port counties. We are currently working on 
additional county-level evidence on employment and wages.</div>

identify the impact of credit constraints on firm-level innovation. We find that access to bank
credit helps firms to adopt existing products and production processes that are new to them.
They introduce these technologies either with the help of suppliers and clients or by acquiring
external know-how. We find no evidence that bank credit also stimulates firm innovation

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13873_abstract">In this paper we extend the Melitz-Ottaviano (2008) model by introducing a fixed cost of
production that can be financed either internally or through external borrowing by firms. In
addition to productivity, firms are also heterogeneous in their financial capability, so that
equally productive firms can finance internally a different share of the fixed cost. By introducing
heterogeneity in financial capability, we can make sense of the empirical finding that firms with
similar levels of productivity end up charging different markups. In particular, our theoretical
model predicts that, conditional on productivity, a higher financial capability is associated with
higher markups. Our setting also allows us to study the implications of changes in the interest
rate faced by firms in their external borrowing. Specifically, the model predicts that an increase
in the lending rate reduces markups; this effect is however mitigated for firms characterized by
higher levels of financial capability. The theoretical results are tested empirically capitalizing on
a representative sample of manufacturing firms (EFIGE) covering seven European countries
(Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain and UK) over the financial crisis.</div>

to explain the characteristics and behavior of discouraged borrowers in the euro area. The
results show that more borrowers are discouraged when the average interest rate charged by
banks is higher, when the potential return on investment is lower, and when the application
costs and opportunity costs of bank lending are higher. In line with the trade-off theory, higher
tax rates lead to lower discouragement. Further, we show that discouragement has strong
negative effects on employment and growth due to the lack of access to finance. However, we
estimate that the majority of discouraged borrowers would be unable to get a loan if they
applied. Finally, we show, consistent with their low approval likelihood that discouraged

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14486_abstract">This
 paper demonstrates high returns to a simple rule-of-thumb tool to help 
farmers manage use of fertilizers, suggesting considerable scope for 
productivity gains through better management of inputs. The green 
revolution led to significant improvements in rice yields in South Asia,
 through the adoption of high-yielding varieties and the increase of 
inputs including fertilizers. Although adoption of fertilizers has been 
high, farmers may still fail to use it efficiently. In a field 
experiment in Bangladesh, I provide treatment farmers with a simple 
rule-of-thumb tool (leaf color chart) to improve the timing of 
fertilizer applications for urea, a popular nitrogen fertilizer. I find 
that treatment group farmers reduce urea use by 8% and that yields 
increase by 7% on average, suggesting there is significant scope to 
improve urea management. Results show that farmers apply urea too early 
in the season, during a period when it is likely to be wasted, and that 
farmers at all levels of urea use can save urea without sacrificing 
yields. Farmers who performed better at baseline have the largest gains 
from treatment. Cost-effectiveness estimates suggest that each $1 spent 
on this intervention produces a return of $9 through a combination of 
savings of urea and higher revenue.</div>

 traders have been the focus of popular resentment throughout the 
history. Food price hikes in 2007-2008 resulted in protests and food 
riots, and spurred governments to intervene in the market. In March 
2011, Bangladesh Government banned Delivery Order traders (DOTs) in 
edible oils market, citing cartelization, and replaced them with a 
dealer’s network appointed by the refiners. The reform provides a 
natural experiment to test the widely-held double marginalization model 
of marketing intermediaries, and to discriminate among alternative 
explanations for the observed price behavior and the role of middlemen 
in the market. We consider competing models that focus on supplier 
credit at low interest rate, and relaxation of credit rationing faced by
 the wholesalers. For empirical analysis, we develop a 
difference-in-difference strategy, with wheat as the comparison 
commodity. The DID design takes into account non-stationarity of 
time-series data and the implications of incomplete pass-through of 
international price in the up and down swing. Long time-series allows 
credible test of the parallel trend assumption. The evidence shows that 
the reform led to (i) an increase in domestic prices and marketing 
margins, and (ii) a weakening of the pass-through of international

credit rationing where the DOTs relax binding credit constraint faced by
 the wholesalers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14488_abstract">Data
 from the garment factories in Bangladesh show that four of every five 
production workers are women, while just over one in 20 supervisors is a
 woman. Is it likely that 95 percent of the management talent comes from
 20 percent of the workforce? We confront this question head on by 
providing training to four women and one man in a large number of 
factories. Promoting all five trainees clearly induces behavior on the 
part of the median factory different from what it has done in the past, 
and almost certainly what it would have done in the absence of our 
intervention. Using a randomly selected comparison group, we examine the
 whether the trainees continue to work at the same factory, whether they
 are given a trial as a supervisor, and whether they are promoted. We 
find that the female trainees are as likely as the male trainees to 
remain at the factory, but less likely to be tried out or to be 
promoted. In management simulation exercises, the female trainees 
outperform the male trainees. Using detailed data from production lines 
on which the trainees work as supervisors, we find some evidence that 
the male trainees outperform the female trainees, though the differences
 across gender are not statistically significant. Evidence from survey 
responses and exercises suggests that the female trainees face some 
initial resistance as supervisors, which could account for the lower 
initial performance on the line.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14489_abstract">We
 examine the long term effects of a well-known maternal and child health
 and family planning program in a rural area of Bangladesh on household 
income. While the population economics of this program have been 
examined elsewhere, none of the studies to date has fully recognized the
 implications for the analysis of program effects of the gap between the
 introduction of the program in 1978 and the collection of the first 
round of detailed economic data as part of a representative survey in 
1996. We argue in particular that there is a need to account for the 
process of household formation and recombination. Indeed, this problem 
arises quite commonly in observational studies of programs because 
baseline surveys as well as information on subsequent household 
composition changes of the study population are not typically available.
 We are able to address these issues in this particular population 
because we have access to a complete registry of migration and household
 residence changes carried out in the study area since 1974. 
Specifically, we develop specialized weights using a novel resampling 
procedure. Our analysis uses those weights in order to examine the 
effect of treatment on household income changes between 1974 and 1996. 
We show a positive impact of treatment on income for the lowest income 
third of the population in 1974 and no effect on the middle and high 
income thirds. We also demonstrate the effect of the weighting procedure
 on results, underscoring the importance for long-term evaluations of 
development interventions to consider the process of household formation
 and recombination.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14273_abstract">Income
 inequality has risen substantially in many developed economies for 
several decades. Economic models, going back at least to Kalecki have 
explored the demand drag caused when a greater share of aggregate income
 accrues to groups that spend a smaller proportion of their income. 
Empirical evidence that this phenomenon has actually affected modern 
economies with rising inequality is rather thin, however. In our recent 
research, we conclude that rising inequality did indeed play a central 
role in the financial dynamics of the household sector that led up to 
the US Great Recession and that elevated income inequality helps to 
explain the remarkably slow recovery of US consumer spending since the 
trough of the recession. In addition, we find that rising inequality is 
correlated with deterioration in a direct measure of financial 
sustainability for US households. This presentation will extend evidence
 from our earlier work to make the argument that rising income 
inequality is a significant barrier to economic growth and full 
employment in the US economy, which through a variety of channels 
affects the rest of the world as well.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14274_abstract">The
 traditional view is that an increase in financialisation is a necessary
 condition for economic development as it leads, inter alia, to a 
greater rate of capital accumulation and a more efficient allocation of 
resources. However, recent empirical research using cross-country panel 
data now suggests that after a certain point an increase in the 
financial sector actually harms growth in the long run. There is also 
evidence that increased income inequality restricts economic growth. 
Moreover, it transpires that an increase in financialisation, in turn, 
worsens income inequality. This may well be a more important factor in 
explaining income inequality than the traditional explanations of 
globalization, skill-biased technical change and disparities in human 
capital formation. The subprime crisis showed many of the failings of 
the deregulated financial sector in especially the US and UK and the 
adverse effect it had on economic activity in the short run. However, 
detailed studies of individual countries, especially the US, suggest 
that the marked increase in inequality is also partly the result of the 
rapid increase in the financial sector. This paper presents an overview 
of these various arguments and presents new empirical evidence on the 
debates.</div>

 closed economy paper that underlies this presentation studies how high 
household leverage and crises can be caused by changes in the income 
distribution. Empirically, the periods 1920–1929 and 1983–2008 both 
exhibited a large increase in the income share of high-income 
households, a large increase in debt leverage of low- and middle-income 
households, and an eventual financial and real crisis. The paper 
presents a theoretical model where higher leverage and crises are the 
endogenous result of a growing income share of high-income households. 
The model matches the profiles of the income distribution, the 
debt-to-income
ratio and crisis risk for the three decades preceding the Great 
Recession.
The open economy paper that underlies this presentation extends this 
model to explore the role of greater income inequality in triggering 
current account imbalances. Current account regressions show that when 
top income shares are added to the comprehensive set of conventional 
explanatory variables used by the IMF, they predict significantly larger
 current account deficits in a cross-section of advanced economies, but 
with important outliers among countries that have pursued export-led 
rather than finance-led growth strategies. To study this mechanism, we 
develop a DSGE model where the income share of top earners increases at 
the expense of bottom earners. Due to preferences for wealth, top 
earners have a much higher marginal propensity to save than bottom 
earners, as they do in the data. We find that, when the redistributive 
shock has a large positive effect on asset values, and if domestic 
financial markets are large, the result will be a sizeable current 
account deficit. On the other hand, when the redistributive shock mostly
 affects relative labor incomes, and if
domestic financial markets are small, the result will be a current 
account surplus.</div>

 January 12, 2010 Haiti Earthquake led to a strong response from donors 
from around the world. Canada, like the US, responded to the disaster by
 providing donor incentives.  The federal government matched donations 
dollar for dollar.  At the provincial level, Quebec provided an 
additional incentive by allowing taxpayers to claim donations made 
between January 12th and February 28th, 2010 on their 2009 tax return. 
This latter incentive provides a natural experiment to study how the 
timing of tax incentives affects charitable donations. We use several 
different estimation techniques to cleanly and robustly estimate the 
effect of the Quebec tax incentive on giving using a panel data set that
 captures tax-receipted giving on individual tax returns at a 
neighbourhood level. Using a propensity score matching method to match 
neighbourhoods in Quebec with neighbourhoods in the rest of Canada, we 
find the incentive led to strong positive effects for both the share of 
tax-filers donating as well as on the level of giving suggesting that 
the increased salience and immediacy of the tax credit increased giving 
on both an extensive and an intensive margin. This result has important 
policy implications and contributes to current debates on the use of tax
 incentives to encourage charitable giving.</div>

							<div class="paper"><font class="paperTitle">Strategic Social Cost of Carbon</font>						
				<div class="author">

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14197_abstract">The
 "social cost of carbon" (SCC) is a concept that reflects the marginal 
external costs of emissions: it represents the monetized damage caused 
by each additional unit of carbon dioxide, or the carbon equivalent of 
another greenhouse gas, emitted into the atmosphere. Several countries, 
including United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, 
and Italy, have begun accounting for the SCC in regulatory impact 
analysis of domestic policy. In doing so, these countries account for 
the global benefits of reducing CO2 emissions in cost-benefit analyses 
of their domestic regulatory actions.

In this paper, I develop a third alternative for conceptualizing the 
right social cost of carbon that countries should use for implementing 
and evaluating domestic climate policy. I refer to it as the "strategic 
social cost of carbon," or SSCC. The SSCC has three important 
characteristics that distinguish it from either a global or domestic 
SCC: (1) it is in each country's own self interest to adapt the SSCC, 
(2) the SSCC internalizes positive externalities from domestic climate 
policy based on reciprocal benefits from other countries, and (3) the 
formulation of the SSCC accounts for a general set of institutional 
frameworks and decision rules in which international agreements on 
climate change may take place. The model shows how countries have 
different incentives regarding the SCC, and for practical purposes, 
seeking the one right SCC upon which there will be international 
agreement is misguided. The results show precisely how countries will 
conceptualize their own SSCC, and I find that countries will always seek
 a higher SSCC than the standard domestic SCC, and that many countries 
have an incentive to pursue domestic policies that imply a SSCC even 
greater than the global SCC. Overall, the analysis provides a

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21986_abstract">This
 paper presents a novel way to disentangle inequality aversion over time
 from inequality aversion between regions in the computation of the 
Social Cost of Carbon. Our approach nests a standard efficiency based 
Social Cost of Carbon estimate and an equity weighted Social Cost of 
Carbon estimate as special cases. We also present a methodology to 
incorporate more fine grained regional resolutions of income and damage 
distributions than typically found in integrated assessment models. 
Finally, we present quantitative estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon 
that use our disentangling of different types of inequality aversion. We
 use two integrated assessment models (FUND and RICE) for our numerical 
exercise to get more robust findings. Our results suggest that 
inequality considerations lead to a higher (lower) SCC values in high 
(low) income regions relative to an efficiency based approach, but that 
the effect is less strong than found in previous studies that use equity
 weighting. Our central estimate is that the Social Cost of Carbon 
increases roughly by a factor of 2.5 from a US perspective when our 
disentangled equity weighting approach is used.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14199_abstract">We
 introduce a novel cap and trade system that eliminates the welfare 
costs of asymmetric information (“uncertainty”). Weitzman (1974) 
compares these welfare costs between a tax and a quantity regulation. In
 the case of CO2, where the marginal damage curve is relatively flat as 
compared to the firm’s marginal cost curve, a tax yields lower welfare 
loss as compared to a cap. Yet, most countries rely on cap and trade 
systems. The European Union’s Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) has 
recently experienced a large fall in permit prices following an 
unforeseen drop in demand. This price plunge, or oversupply of 
certificates, leaves cheap abatement options idle. Similarly, a positive
 demand shock can lead to excessively high abatement costs. The 
possibility of these high costs are an obstacle to using a tight cap.

Hybrid cap and trade-systems use a price floor and a price ceiling to 
reduce the welfare cost from fluctuations in the firm’s marginal 
abatement costs. Our proposed smart cap takes the cap and trade system 
one step further by fully eliminating these welfare costs, making it 
superior also to a tax. In addition, the smart cap does not require a 
regulator to buy up certificates in the case of oversupply, addressing 
both cost and commitment concerns governing such “central bank” 
intervention currently discussed for the next phase of the EU-ETS. We 
discuss how the mechanism affects dynamic certificate trading and 
information aggregation across firms. To date, socially optimal emission
 reductions are the exception rather than the rule. The mechanism 
improves efficiency whenever there is a non-trivial trade-off between 
uncertain cost fluctuations and a quantitative emission target. In 
addition, the smart cap can help parties to agree on the target by 
implementing a “do more (only) if it is cheaper” approach.</div>

 study collective choice when individuals have heterogeneous discounted 
utilitarian preferences.  Two attractive properties of intertemporal 
preferences are indistinguishable for individuals, but have dramatically
 different implications for social preferences: Time consistency 
requires a plan that is optimal at one evaluation date to be optimal at 
all later evaluation dates, while time invariance requires preferences 
to be invariant under translations of the time axis.  We study the 
implications of these two properties in a tractable dynamic model that 
captures both common resource and public goods problems.  Social 
planners implement the first best if collective preferences are time 
consistent, but not if they are time invariant.  Decentralized 
alternatives -- property rights (for common resources), and voting (for 
public goods) --  can improve on the planning equilibrium if social 
preferences are time invariant.  We reflect on the implications of these
 findings for dynamic welfare economics. Time consistency/invariance is a
 plausible normative property in some applications, but not in others.</div>

conjecture that corporate managers located near major terrorist attacks 
will experience negative emotions, which would induce them to adopt more
 conservative corporate policies. Consistent with our conjecture, we 
demonstrate that firms located near terrorist events increase their cash
 holdings, and reduce their R&amp;D expenditure and their long-term 
leverage around the events. These effects are temporary, become weaker 
as the distance between the firm and the event location increases, and 
are mainly concentrated among firms managed by younger CEOs. Using 
multiple media proxies to capture the saliency of negative events, we 
also find that events with greater media exposure are associated with

 paper presents a new way of solving the Melitz model using simple and 
intuitive diagrams. We show that these new techniques can be used to 
solve a multi-industry version of the Melitz model where there are 
asymmetries in tariff rates both across countries and across industries 
within a country. Our main finding is that when one country opens up to 
trade in one industry but not another, there are two possible effects on
 industrial productivity. If the liberalized industry is relatively 
small, then productivity falls in the liberalized industry and rises in 
the non-liberalized industry. On the other hand, if the liberalized 
industry is relatively large, then productivity rises in the liberalized
 industry and rises even more in the non-liberalized industry. The 
welfare of the liberalizing country rises regardless of whether 
productivity rises or falls in the liberalized industry.</div>

 paper integrates fertility choice and exhaustible resource dynamics in a
 tractable model of endogenous technological change. The analysis shows 
that, under the right conditions, the interdependence of population, 
resources and technology produces a transition from unsustainable 
resource-based growth to sustainable knowledge-based growth that 
consists of three phases: (1) an initial phase where agents build up the
 economy by exploiting exhaustible natural resources to support 
population growth; (2) an intermediate phase where agents turn on the 
Schumpeterian engine of endogenous innovation in response to 
population-led market expansion; (3) a terminal phase where growth 
becomes fully driven by knowledge accumulation and no longer requires 
growth of physical inputs. The last phase is crucial: not only economic 
growth no longer requires growth of physical inputs, but technological 
change also compensates for the exhaustion of the natural resource 
stock.</div>

 Great Recession has led economists back to the study of history; 
however, the majority of these backward glances have focused on periods 
of financial panics rather than the broader evolution of the financial 
system that led to those panics. The few long-run studies have focused 
on specific financial regulation such as double liability (Grossman 
2001), capital requirements (Grossman 2010), reserve requirements 
(Carlson 2014), and bank supervision (Mitchener and Jaremski 2015). 
These factors undoubtedly have an effect on the stability and growth of 
the financial system, but it is less clear how they affect its 
structure. Concerns over bank concentration and systemically important 
institutions are not a new problem. Even putting aside issues of 
systemically important financial institutions, banking industry 
structure may affect how efficiently commercial banks perform their core
 functions of offering savings and lending facilities to their local 
communities, which in turn would influence their effect on growth and 
development. Using a comprehensive collection of bank-level data, we 
study the concentration of U.S. commercial banking at the state-level

 1931, the world economy experienced one of the most severe financial 
crises of history. From May to July, a series of financial panics shook 
Central Europe and brought down the currencies and banking systems of 
Austria, Hungary and Germany. In order to thwart capital outflows, 
Central European governments reacted by suspending foreign exchange 
payments, leading all borrowers from the region to default on their 
short-term foreign debts (Harris, 1935, Ellis, 1941, Ritschl, 2002). The
 second half of 1931 was then marked by dramatic financial instability 
across almost all countries. Financial troubles in the European 
periphery soon spread to the center of the global financial system. A 
speculative attack on the pound sterling pushed the United Kingdom off 
the gold standard in September, while the United States witnessed a 
severe banking panic in the summer.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21742_abstract">How
 did pre-Fed banking crises end? During the National Banking Era, 
1863-1914, banks responded to the severe panics by suspending 
convertibility, that is, they refused to exchange cash for their 
liabilities (checking accounts). During the suspension period bank 
depositors’ beliefs, which had led to the panic to start with, changed 
and they no longer desired to run on their banks. At the start of the 
suspension period, the private clearing houses cut off bank specific 
information. Member banks were legally united into a single entity by 
the issuance of emergency loan certificates, effectively a joint 
liability. A new market for certified checks opened, pricing the risk of
 clearing house failure. Certified checks traded at a discount to cash 
in a market that opened during the suspension period. Confidence was 
restored when the currency premium reached zero.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21743_abstract">Using
 a new daily dataset for all stocks traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange, we study the impact of information asymmetry during the 
liquidity freeze and market run of October 1907 - one of the most severe
 financial crises of the 20th century. We estimate that the run on the 
market increased spreads from 0.5% to 3% during the peak of the crisis 
and, using a spread decomposition, we also demonstrate that fears of 
informed trading account for most of that deterioration of liquidity. 
Information costs rose most in the mining sector - the origin of the 
panic rumors - and in other sectors with poor track records of corporate
 reporting. In addition to wider spreads and tight money markets, we 
find other hallmarks of information-based illiquidity: trading volume 
dropped and price impact rose. Importantly, despite short-term cash 
infusions into the market, we find that the market remained relatively 
illiquid for several months following the panic. We go on to show that 
rising illiquidity enters positively in the cross section of stock 
returns. Thus, our findings demonstrate how opaque markets can easily 
transmit an idiosyncratic rumor into a long-lasting, market-wide crisis.
 Our results also demonstrate the usefulness of illiquidity measures to 
alert market participants to impending market runs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21744_abstract">This
 paper reviews some of the most prominent asset price bubbles from the 
past 400 years and documents how central banks (or other institutions) 
reacted to those bubbles. The historical evidence suggests that the 
emergence of bubbles is often preceded or accompanied by an expansionary
 monetary policy, lending booms, capital inflows, and financial 
innovation or deregulation. We find that the severity of the economic 
crisis following the bursting of a bubble is less linked to the type of 
asset than to the financing of the bubble—crises are most severe when 
accompanied by a lending boom and high leverage of market players, and 
when financial institutions themselves are participating in the buying 
frenzy. Past experience also suggests that a purely passive “cleaning up
 the mess” stance toward the buildup of bubbles is, in many cases, 
costly. Monetary policy and macroprudential measures that lean against 
inflating bubbles can and sometimes have helped deflate bubbles and 
mitigate the associated economic crises. However, the correct 
implementation of such proactive policy approaches remains fraught with 
difficulties.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21745_abstract">Reducing
 systemic liquidity risk related to seasonal swings in loan demand was 
one reason for the founding of the Fed. Existing evidence on the 
post-Fed increase in the seasonal volatility of aggregate lending and 
the decrease in seasonal interest rate swings suggests that it succeeded
 in that mission. Nevertheless, less than 8 percent of state-chartered 
banks joined the Fed in its first decade. Some have speculated that 
non-members could avoid higher costs of Fed reserve requirements while 
still obtaining access indirectly to the Fed discount window through 
contacts with Fed members. We find that individual bank attributes 
related to the extent of banks’ ability to mitigate seasonal loan demand
 variation predict banks’ decisions to join the Fed. Consistent with the
 notion that banks could obtain indirect access to the discount window 
through interbank transfers, we find that a bank’s position within the 
interbank network (as a user or provider of liquidity) predicts the 
timing of its entry into the Fed system and the effect of Fed membership
 on its lending behavior. We also find that indirect access to the Fed 
was not as good as direct access. Fed member banks saw a greater 
increase in lending than non-member banks.</div>

 accuracy is typically measured in terms of a given loss function. As a 
consequence, the relative ranking of forecasts from (possibly) 
misspecified models varies across different loss functions. This paper 
develops a novel criterion for forecast evaluation, based on the entire 
distribution of forecast errors. We introduce the concepts of 
general-loss (GL) forecast superiority and convex-loss (CL) forecast 
superiority, and we establish a mapping between GL (CL) superiority and 
first (second) order stochastic dominance. This allows us to develop a 
testing procedure based on an out-of-sample generalization of the tests 
introduced by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005). The asymptotic null 
distributions are nonstandard and some resampling procedure is used to 
obtain the critical values. The tests are consistent and have nontrivial
 local power under a sequence of local alternatives. We further show 
that the tests could be extended to heterogeneous processes. Monte Carlo
 simulations suggest that the tests perform reasonably well in finite 
samples. An application to exchange rate data indicates that our tests 
can help identify some superior forecasting models regardless the forms 
of the loss functions.</div>

 important input to monetary policymaking is estimating the current 
level of inflation. This paper examines empirically whether the 
measurement of trend inflation can be improved by using disaggregated 
data on sectoral inflation to construct indexes akin to core inflation, 
but with time-varying weights, where the sectoral weight depends on the 
time-varying volatility and persistence of the sectoral inflation 
series, and on the comovement among sectors. The model is estimated 
using U.S. data on 16 components of the personal consumption expenditure
 inflation index. The modeling framework is a dynamic factor model with 
time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility as in del Negro and 
Otrok (2008); this is the multivariate extension of the univariate 
unobserved components-stochastic volatility model of trend inflation in 
Stock and Watson (2007). Our main empirical results are (i) the 
resulting multivariate estimate of trend inflation is similar to the 
univariate estimate of trend inflation computed using core PCE inflation
 (excluding food and energy) in the first half of the sample, but 
introduces food in the second half of the sample: early in the sample, 
food inflation was noisy and a poor indicator of trend inflation, but 
now food inflation is less volatile, more persistent, and a useful 
indicator; (ii) the model-based filtering uncertainty about trend 
inflation is substantially reduced by using the disaggregated series in a
 multivariate model, relative to computing the trend using only headline
 inflation; (iii) the multivariate trend and the univariate trend of 
PCE-ex-energy inflation have lower forecast error at the one- and 
two-year horizon than a variety of other benchmark inflation measures, 
with the univariate trend of PCE-ex-energy improving slightly upon the 
multivariate trend.</div>

 examine the impact of government funding  for R&amp;D on privately 
performed R&amp;D and its ultimate effect on productivity growth. To 
deal with the potential endogeneity of where governments choose to 
allocate R&amp;D funds, we use changes across countries and industries 
in defense R&amp;D spending. Shocks to defense R&amp;D are mainly driven
 by geopolitical factors that are arguably unrelated to industry shocks.
 We uncover strong evidence of “crowding in” rather than “crowding out”,
 as increases in government funded R&amp;D result in significant 
increases in private sector R&amp;D. Specifically, a $1 of government 
financed R&amp;D generates $2 - $6 of additional privately funded 
R&amp;D. Analysis of the wage and employment effects suggests that the 
increase in private R&amp;D expenditures reflect actual increases in 
R&amp;D employment, not just higher labor costs. In turn, increases in 
R&amp;D in a country and industry pair result in size able productivity 
gains. A permanent one percentage point increase in the ratio of defense
 related R&amp;D to value added is associated with a 5% increase in the 
annual TFP growth rate in that country - industry pair (e.g. from 1.0 to
 1.05 percentage points a year). We estimate that the increase in US 
defense R&amp;D caused by the 9/11 events, for example, generated an 
increase in the aggregate annual TFP growth rate of  2% in the US. At 
the international level, we find that increased R&amp;D spending by 
foreign governments has two offsetting effects on domestic firms. On the
 one hand, it deters R&amp;D spending by domestic firms; on the other 
hand it creates some beneficial  domestic productivity gains through 
industry - specific knowledge spillovers. On net, the effect of foreign 
R&amp;D on domestic productivity is significantly positive (but small in
 magnitude), pointing to the global benefits of national R&amp;D 
increases.</div>

 developing economies such as China share some common characteristics of
 labor markets: college enrollment expanded rapidly, the college premium
 for young workers declined while that for senior workers increased, and
 wage inequality rose. We build a general equilibrium theory that 
considers two dimensions of human capital, i.e., education and labor 
market experience, and education is endogenously determined and elastic 
while the accumulation of labor market experience takes time. Firms have
 heterogeneous products and productivities. As a result, workers with 
different types of human capital are not substitutable in equilibrium. 
In this framework, an increase in the demand for high-skilled workers 
could be the driving force for the observed facts in fast growing 
economies, but a supply shock of college graduates cannot generate the 
same labor market dynamics. The college premium for young graduates is 
depressed because many young college graduates can be produced in a 
short time in response to the demand shock, while experienced college 
graduates are in shortage and enjoy a rising premium in both the short 
and medium run. Despite a low college premium in the short run, young 
individuals still flood into colleges because they foresee a high 
lifetime return to education. The policy of expanding college enrollment
 is conformable to the response to a rising demand for human capital, 
and can help to reduce inequality in the long run.</div>

idiosyncratic risk varies over time in accordance with recent empirical 
findings.  The model's income process is calibrated to match the 
cyclicality of earnings risks documented by Guvenen et al. (2013).  
Market incompleteness raises the volatility of aggregate consumption 
growth by 49 percent relative to a complete markets benchmark.  More 
than half of this increase is due to the time-varying precautionary 
saving motive that results from changes in the nature of idiosyncratic 
risks over the cycle.  Idiosyncratic risk spiked during the Great 
Recession and this contributed 2.3 percentage points to the decline in 
aggregate consumption.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21904_abstract">In
 this paper, I quantify the importance of aggregate fluctuations in 
microeconomic uncertainty for the firm dynamics over the business cycle 
in an economy with frictional financial markets. To begin, I document 
facts on asymmetric response across age and size groups of firms in the 
U.S. to the changes in aggregate economic conditions. I argue that age 
rather than size is a relevant margin for the cyclical employment 
dynamics; in particular total employment of young firms varies 2.6 times
 more relative to the old firms. Then I propose a theory that, contrary 
to the existing studies, generates endogenously a link between firm's 
age and size and its ability to obtain financing, and induces an 
asymmetric response to shocks. A key element of my theory is a financial
 friction, originated from the firm's private information and long-term,
 efficient lending contract between a risk averse entrepreneur and 
financial intermediary, which manifests itself as a borrowing 
constraint. I argue that, for any given expected return on project, 
young firms are more constrained in borrowing and they grow out of the 
constraint as they age up to the optimal, unconstrained size. Next I 
establish that, for any given age, firm's financing increases in line 
with the average return on a project. In times of high idiosyncratic 
uncertainty the financial contract calls for tightening of the borrowing
 constraint transmitting the initial impulse into a decline in demand 
for production inputs and further, including general equilibrium 
effects, into an economic downturn. This mechanism affects 
disproportionally young firms. Not only are they more constrained in 
borrowing but also they start smaller due to a reduced level of initial 
financing.</div>

 types of uncertainty shocks can explain many phenomena in 
macroeconomics and finance. But does this amount to throwing in a new, 
exogenous, unobserved shock to explain every challenging feature of 
business cycles? This paper explores the origin of micro uncertainty 
(uncertainty about firm-level shocks), macro uncertainty (uncertainty 
about aggregate shocks) and higher-order uncertainty shocks 
(disagreement) in a unified econometric framework. When agents use 
standard econometric techniques and real-time data to re-estimate 
parameters that govern the probability of black swans (unobserved 
extreme events), micro, macro and higher-order uncertainty covary just 
like their empirical counterparts. The results teach us that 
time-varying disaster risk and the many shades of uncertainty shocks are
 not distinct phenomena. All originate from using macro data to 
re-estimate the true probability distribution of economic outcomes.</div>

 drives countercyclical volatility? A large literature has documented 
that many economic variables are more disperse in recessions, but this 
could either occur because shocks get bigger or because firms respond 
more to shocks which are the same size. Existing evidence that the 
dispersion of endogenous variables rises in recessions cannot tell us 
which of volatility or responsiveness is getting bigger, and these two 
explanations have very different policy implications. However, we 
document new facts in the open economy environment and show that they 
can be used to disentangle these explanations. In particular, we use 
confidential BLS micro data to show that there is a robust positive 
relationship between exchange rate pass-through and the dispersion of 
item-level price changes. We then argue that changes in responsiveness 
can explain this fact while volatility shocks cannot.</div>

 mechanisms used by platform markets suffer from two problems. First, 
buyers may draw conclusions about the quality of the platform from 
single transactions, causing a reputational externality. Second, 
reputation measures may be coarse or biased, preventing buyers from

 claim that platforms can benefit from identifying and promoting higher

was based upon the personal and social connections she facilitated by 
entertaining bankers, scientists, and professional economists such as 
Malthus, Ricardo, Mill and others, from Britain and the continent, at 
her London  salon, culturally rooted in the Genevan expatriate 
community. It was extended to the middle classes through the many 
editions of her Conversations On Political Economy. Her networks were 
enlarged to include the working classes as she constructed her John 
Hopkin’s Notions on Political Economy at the behest of Henry Brougham 
and the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Her work was not a
 simple vulgarization of knowledge created by others, but rather active 
work at the boundaries of various bodies of discourse among which 
knowledge flowed in all directions.</div>

 on the early decades of economics disciplinary professionalization, 
women economists faced numerous barriers to entry as well as limited 
support into academic economics.   The paper outlines evidence for a 
variety of discriminatory barriers as well as for limited support.  A 
small handful of acclaim-receiving women economists navigated the 
barriers, with productive, respected academic economist careers 
beginning in the early twentieth century; some women economists made 
acclaimed contributions and then either actively chose alternatives to 
economics or more passively succumbed to the barriers; the majority of 
women economists did not rise in the ranks of academia to the extent of 
their male colleagues.  This paper assesses the biographical experiences
 and academic contributions of a handful of acclaim-receiving women 
economists from the early twentieth century to address the question: How
 did a small number of women economists who received professional 
accolades for their economic thought in the early twentieth century fare
 in productivity, in their careers and in their reception within 
economics?  The hypothesized answer involves multi-dimensional barriers,
 limited supports, and response paths. </div>

 economists in the United States trained in the most rigorous PhD

They were considered strong, often exceptional, students, but were 
rarely able to find academic positions similar to those of their male 
peers in university economics departments.  Instead, many of them taught
 in women's colleges, state universities, and, occasionally, in research
 units in private universities.  This paper will focus on U.S. women 
academic economists' research contributions to the developing field and 
on their impact on the culture of the institutions in which they taught

implied financing rates (IFRs). The IFRs can be viewed as measures of collateral scarcity
and funding liquidity in the MBS market. A decline (rise) in the IFR can be interpreted as a
signal that the MBS collateral is more scarce (readily available) and can be funded at a lower
(higher) cost. Our results suggest that factors representing higher net supply are generally
associated with lower implied financing rates. In addition, we find that liquidity risk is
compensated in the cross-section of expected returns—agency MBS that have a higher beta with
respect to liquidity shocks on average deliver higher returns—and that liquidity risk premiums
are separate from the premiums associated with prepayment and agency credit risks.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14139_abstract">Neocorporatism -- a system of close collaboration between workers, employers and
government -- helped to restrain wages, encourage investment and foster economic
growth for a quarter of a century following World War II. After approximately 1973,
that system worked less successfully, prompting movement in the direction of labor
market decentralization. Yet Europe's quasi-decentralized labor markets did not prevent
inefficiencies and imbalances from mounting, culminating in a crisis. This paper asks why. It
then draws out the implications for the evolving structure of European labor markets.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14140_abstract">With the Wage-Price Guideposts in 1962, the United States was one of the few countries to
introduce an incomes policy before inflation was a problem; the objective was to forestall
inflation as the economy moved out of a recession. There has been no mention of using
incomes policy for this purpose during the current expansion or during any expansion of the
U.S. economy over the past 35 years. This paper argues that this silence reflects the absence
of both theoretical and institutional prerequisites for a viable incomes policy.</div>

 the wake of challenges to affirmative action and the implementation of 
alternative admission regimes, access to oversubscribed elite public 
universities remains a contentious issue. Much of the research on these 
issues focuses on freshman admissions.
There is little research that examines the development of alternative 
pathways to elite public universities. This paper examines the 
University of Texas at Austin’s Coordinated Admission Program. This 
program offers Texas residents that failed to gain admission as freshman
 the option of transferring from a participating University of Texas 
system institution to the University of Texas at Austin provided that 
the students complete 30 hours in their freshman year at the satellite 
university, complete a set of prescribed courses, and maintain the 
minimum required grade point average. This paper examines the effect of 
reaching the minimum grade threshold on the likelihood of transfer, 
graduation, choice of major, and earnings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14370_abstract">Recent
 research has focused on the worrisome phenomenon of undermatch, where 
highly-qualified students do not apply to high-ranking universities, 
despite affirmative action in admissions and the availability of 
generous financial aid. But what determines where a student chooses to 
apply? We examine the population of Texas high school graduates who 
apply to four-year colleges and consider what factors affect their 
application behavior. Most importantly, we are not limited to examining 
only the highest achieving students. Because there is a common college 
application in Texas, we are able to observe whether each high school 
student applied to any four-year public postsecondary institution in the
 state. The notion of undermatch assumes that we are able to determine 
what constitutes a good match.
Unlike previous studies, we construct multiple measures of 
student-college matching, such as closest student-college match based on
 student preparedness by campus enrollment characteristics and 
completion characteristics. However, deconstructing potential causes of 
student-college match behavior is difficult because institutions vary in
 admissions strategies, levels of diversity, and location. Thus, we use a
 conditional logit strategy that enable us to analyze the 
characteristics of institutions, such as cost (e.g., application cost, 
tuition and fees, financial aid, and distance from students home), 
immediate consumption benefits (e.g., campus racial and ethnic 
diversity, quality and similarity of peers, academic quality, location
(urban, rural, etc.), and future returns (e.g., debt versus future 
earnings, probability of graduation, employment opportunities) that 
affect student’s likelihood of applying to college.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14371_abstract">We
 examine the educational impact of gender-neutral custody laws on child 
outcomes. Between the 1970s and 1990s, state custody laws moved from 
maternal preference to the “best interests of the child” doctrine which 
gives fathers and mothers equal treatment in child custody cases, a 
change that is independent of divorce law reforms. While standard 
household bargaining models predict that changes in custody laws give 
fathers greater bargaining power in marriages, the net effect of the 
custody law reform on all children is unknown. We exploit the exogenous 
variation across states in the timing of custody law changes to estimate
 the long-term implications of exposure to a gender-neutral custody law 
regime. We find that childhood exposure to gender-neutral custody laws 
has a negative and significant effect on educational attainment, both 
the likelihood of completion of schooling milestones and years of 
education. For example, a man exposed to the new custody law as a child 
is less likely to graduate from high school by, on average, 2.04 
percentage points. Results are similar for women. Moreover, the negative
 effects are independent of the effects of childhood exposure to 
unilateral divorce laws.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14372_abstract">The
 peer effects literature on student outcomes has produced mixed results.
 Critics argue that the literature fails to properly correct for the 
endogeneity problem. This study proposes an experimental design to 
extrapolate the effects of environment on student performance and 
assessment of instruction. The sample population is drawn from a 
Hispanic servicing institution. We randomized a set of treatments that 
differ only in the context of the learning environment. We show that 
institution and instructor’s poor character hurt the assessment of 
instructor and lecture. Further, we find institutional qualities on 
student assessments to be secondary to the character of the instructor. 
In addition, we find little evidence that institutional and instructor 
characteristics affect student performance on an exam. Our results 
suggest that endogenous concerns in the peer effects literature may be 
over stated.</div>

 paper estimates the impact of armed conflict on subsequent health 
outcomes using detailed geographic information on households’ distance 
from conflict sites—a more accurate measure of conflict exposure— and 
compares the impact on children exposed in utero versus after birth. The
 identification strategy relies on exogenous variation in the conflict’s
 geographic extent and timing as well as the exposure of different birth
 cohorts while in utero or after birth. Results show that war-exposed 
children subsequently have lower height-for-age Z-scores, and impacts 
using GPS information are 87-188% larger than if exposure is measured at
 the imprecise regional level. Effects of in utero and after birth 
exposure are comparable in magnitude, and children in the war 
instigating and losing country (Eritrea) suffer more than the winning 
nation (Ethiopia). Results are robust to including region-specific time 
trends, alternative conflict exposure measures, and addressing potential
 bias due to selective migration.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14075_abstract">The
 civil war in Syria has culminated into major refugee crises in its 
neighboring countries. By the end of 2013 more than half a million 
people were seeking shelter in cities and refugee camps in Turkey. We 
analyze how the Syrian refugee influx in Turkey has affected food and 
housing prices, employment rates and internal migration patterns in 
regions of Turkey where refugees are being accommodated. Refugee camps 
are geographically concentrated near the Syrian border, which enables us
 to employ the rest of regional Turkey as control group with a 
difference-in-difference approach to analyze the impact on local 
economies. Our findings suggest that housing and to a lesser degree food
 prices increased, but employment rates of natives in various skill 
groups are largely unaffected. Incumbent natives appear to be staying 
put considering the limited migration out of the region, but there is a 
significant decline in internal migration into regions hosting refugees.
 Nevertheless, the decline in internal in-migration is less than a tenth
 of the refugee influx, implying that there is little evidence of 
refugees crowding out natives in local labor markets</div>

 exposure to financial markets change political choices and attitudes 
towards conflict? We provide the first experimental evidence on the 
effect of exposure to stock markets on support for peace. Prior to the 
2015 Israeli elections we randomly assign individuals in Israel 
financial assets, allowing them to make weekly trades. The assets 
include stocks from both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We then 
evaluate changes in their voting decisions and attitudes toward the 
peace process. We find that exposure to the stock market raises support 
for a peace deal, and shifts votes in the election towards left parties 
favoring the re-opening of peace negotiations. The effect comes mainly 
from individuals with less prior exposure to the stock markets. We 
interpret these results as reflecting how learning about financial 
opportunities create common interests in peace and how rational 
interests mitigate the emotive legacies of ethnic conflict.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14324_abstract">In
 the last 15 years, the rates of both residential mobility and 
employer-switching have declined.  Data from the Current Population 
Survey and American Community Survey have shown that the magnitudes of 
the two declines are similar. Using linked employer-employee data in 
conjunction with these survey data, we do a thorough comparison of the 
trends and conclude that about a third of the decline in interstate 
residential migration is associated with a direct job-to-job flow, even 
though only a small fraction of the decline in employer-switching is 
associated with job change that involves an inter-state move. We also 
conduct a shift-share analysis to measure the effects of changes in 
demographic composition on the changes in the two migration measures. We
 find that only a small fraction of the migration declines can be 
attributed to compositional changes, leaving most of the decline 
unexplained.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14325_abstract">The
 so-called “Great Compression” of the 1940s, when the American economy 
saw a substantial decline in earnings inequality, presents curious 
patterns of divergent wage compression by age and occupation groups.  
Specifically, the wage gap narrowed between the old and the young in 
general, but the rate of wage compression varied substantially within 
age groups.  I find that demand factors played crucial roles in the 
age-differential compression of wage structures; the increase in demand 
in manufacturing during WWII is associated with higher earnings of 
middle-skilled workers among the young, and the post-war construction 
boom boosted demand for workers in low-skilled occupations of all ages. 
 Key to variations in compression by age is the differences in 
substitutability between workers of different ages by skill groups.  
Among low-skilled workers, young and old workers are highly 
substitutable and a high demand for young workers leads to an increase 
in demand for older workers.  On the other hand, for high-skilled 
workers the substitutability between workers of different ages is low 
and an increase in demand for young workers does not necessarily 
translate into high demand for older workers.  The estimates of 
elasticity of substitution for different skill groups confirm this view.
  Finally, I demonstrate the usual institutional factors, e.g., the 
minimum wage increase, the rise of unionization, and the decline in 
labor force participation by the old due to old-age insurance, play a 
little role in the wage compression.  The paper shows that even an 
extremely large aggregate shock transmits through the labor market via 
cohort effects because of imperfect substitutability of workers of 
different ages.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14326_abstract">During
 the last three decades, the U.S. labor market has been characterized by
 its employment polarization. As jobs in the middle of the skill 
distribution have shrunk, employment has expanded for the high and 
low-skill occupations. However, real wages have not followed the same 
pattern. While earnings for the high-skill occupations have risen 
robustly, wages for both the low and middle-skill workers have remained 
subdued. We attribute this outcome to the rise in offshoring and 
low-skilled immigration, and develop a three-country stochastic growth 
model to rationalize their asymmetric effect on employment and wages, as
 well as their implications for U.S. welfare. In the model, the increase
 in offshoring negatively affects the middle-skill occupations but 
benefits the high-skill ones, which in turn boosts aggregate 
productivity. As the income of high-skill occupations rises, so does the
 demand for complementary services provided by low-skill workers, which 
generates employment polarization. However, low-skill wages remain 
depressed due to the rise in low-skilled immigration. Native workers 
react to immigration by upgrading the skill content of their labor tasks
 as they invest in training, which further boosts aggregate 
productivity. We show that offshoring and low-skilled immigration 
improve aggregate welfare in the U.S. economy, notwithstanding their 
asymmetric impact on native workers of different skill levels. The model
 is estimated with multilateral trade-weighted macroeconomic indicators 
and data on enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border.</div>

 paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool

the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79 data. The paper 
finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and

also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function, by omitting 
measures of non-cognitive skills on the right hand side, overestimates 
the rate of return to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14414_abstract">We
 examine the export dynamics of the Turkish manufacturing industry to 
reveal the limitations of export-oriented growth in a financially 
dependent economy. Turkey’s export performance since 2002 has been 
celebrated as success - exports grew 15 percent a year on average in 
dollar terms, more than six percentage points above the average global 
growth of exports, and as much as the pace of expansion in Brazil, 
Russia, and India. This growth was coupled with changing technological 
intensity of exports, as mid-tech exports (mainly automobiles and auto 
parts) replaced “less sophisticated products” (garments and textiles) 
and allowed the country to narrow the ‘sophistication gap’ with 
countries such as Poland and Mexico” (World Bank 2014). To assess the 
sustainability of growth performance based on exports, we compare 
technological intensity, R&amp;D and foreign component of value added 
across sectors. Our analysis suggests that new exporters are not 
investing in better technologies and not creating domestic value added. 
Recent change in the structure of manufacturing exports has been closely
 linked with higher import share of exports as well as higher 
indebtedness of firms. The case of Turkey sheds light on the mechanisms 
through which, a non-commodity exporter country in periphery is 
integrated with core countries in a new form of financial dependency.</div>

 countries in 1995-2008 have experienced what we call the “value-added 
erosion”, which describes the phenomenon of the decline in the sectoral 
shares of domestic value-added in a country’s exports as the country 
becomes more integrated into the Global Value Chains (GVCs). We argue 
that the decline of domestic value added share in a country’s exports is
 likely to be caused by the expansion of high value-adding activities 
performed by foreign lead firms in the upper stream of the GVCs. The 
variables of interest namely, domestic value-added share in exports, and
 foreign high skilled labor embodied in a country’s exports (a proxy for
 foreign lead’s firm’s high value-adding activities) were estimated 
using a multi-regional global input-output model. Using these results as
 well as other control variables we applied a panel cointegration model 
to explain and assess the likelihood of value-added erosion and its 
possible determinants.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14416_abstract">After
 growing for most of the 1980s and 1990s, income inequality in Latin 
America has reversed course during the last few years. Declining levels 
of inequality are a welcomed change for a region that has typically 
topped the charts in this regard. Even more promising is the fact that 
this recent decline has also been accompanied by significant reductions 
in poverty rates. The literature has typically explained the decline in 
inequality as the result of two main factors: a decrease in the skill 
premium, and the reduced inequality in terms of non-wage 
income—primarily driven by the successful implementation of conditional 
income-transfer programs. We propose that these two are mainly channels 
through which changing terms of trade have affected inequality, 
particularly in light of the recent “commodities boom” and the favorable
 conditions that it has provided to the region. This paper reassesses 
the effects of trade on inequality by evaluating the degree to which 
these follow traditional comparative advantage theories. Using data for 
eighteen Latin American countries during the 1995-2012 period, we find 
overall evidence to support that terms of trade are inversely related to
 inequality. Moreover, we demonstrate that this effect is only 
significant for countries with moderate to high export concentration 
levels, and explore these in more detail through case studies. Finally, 
we acknowledge that the current trade patterns run the risk of proving 
ephemeral due to the vagaries of international markets, and discuss 
policy implications for sustaining this recent decline in inequality in 
the region.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14417_abstract">Globalization
 has so many meanings that the word has become almost meaningless: 
neoliberalism, free trade, and corporate power, only to mention a few; 
none of which serve the public interest. Globalization, propped up by 
trade negotiations written by corporate lobbyists has proved effective 
in limiting government regulation needed to protect society. 
Globalization also threatens indigenous cultures. This paper will look 
at globalization from the standpoint of the shuffling of power 
relations. One of the most important effects of globalization -- secrecy
 has facilitated all sorts of power. Perhaps the best-known dimension of
 secrecy is its role in tax evasion. On the most obvious level, 
globalization serves as a weapon to make labor more subservient.  
Globalization reinforces the power of powerful countries in the name of 
free trade.  These so-called free trade treaties are written to serve 
the narrow interests of domestic business versus foreign competitors by 
strengthening intellectual property.  In so doing, it brazenly treats 
monopoly power as if monopoly were a form of laissez-faire.</div>

 has so many meanings that the word has become almost meaningless: There
 has been a tendency throughout Latin America, in recent decades of the 
expansion of activities associated with reprimarization. The latter 
refers to all activities of extractivism, such as mining and petroleum, 
as well as agricultural activities, such as cattle and soy. These are 
linked to the strong growth of the commodities markets and the amazing 
growth of China. This paper examines the implications for both the 
environment and development, in general, and considers the currently 
active development trajectories critically and presents alternative 
trajectories of development for the region.  In examining the shift to 
reprimarization in Latin America there are a range of key impacts on the
 environment. The following issues are very much connected to the shifts
 toward reprimarization: (1) deforestation of the Amazon Rain Forest 
linked to, lumber, cattle and soy; (2) air, water, and soil pollution 
linked to the use of pesticides, and mining; (3) soil erosion as a 
result of mining and soy. There are also major socio-environmental 
issues around the issue of hydroelectric dams, strongly tied to mining. 
  Many progressives are calling into question this extractivist model of
 development. Beyond the environment, major concerns are with respect to
 industry, wages, informal work, and the perennial problem of being just
 primary goods providers to the 1st world, rather than seeking a means 
by which a serious alternative development trajectory could be pursued.</div>

reconstruction of Piero Sraffa’s early views on Classical Political 
Economy. The paper focuses on evidence gathered from a selection of 
documents concerning the preparation of Sraffa’s own Lectures on the 
Advanced Theory of Value, believed to have been delivered in the second 
half of the 1920s in Cambridge.</div>

 The study employs autoregressive distributed lag model to establish the
 relationships among changes in exchange rate, prices, petroleum prices,
 interest rates, cocoa prices, among others, after using 1988 to account
 for an exogenous structural change. Two price indices are employed 
alternatively to capture prices in the study, because of the 
introduction of new cedi in 2007 to facilitate the role of money as 
medium of exchange to enhance transactions in the country. Results of 
empirical analysis show that the extent of exchange rate pass-through to
 inflation in the country is incomplete but fairly larger than those 
observed on the average in other studies for advanced developed 
countries (ADCs). Additionally, the size of the exchange-rate 
pass-through to inflation is slightly larger in the short-run than in 
the long-run. The estimated impulse response functions show that 
inflation reinforces itself, increases Treasury Bills rates, and 
contributes more to depreciation than the latter’s effect on inflation. 
Improvements in cocoa prices strengthen the cedi’s value, and dampen 
Treasury Bills rates, although they slightly bump up inflation. However,
 increase in petroleum prices also depreciates the cedi, although it is 
not very inflationary. Monetary Authorities are cautioned that although 
monetary policy is effective and can be used to curb inflation, its 
excessive expansionary use is inflationary, and is the chief source of 
depreciation of the cedi.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13865_abstract">Abstract:
 It has been well documented that the volatility of inflation exhibits a
 high degree of time variation.  Few studies on explaining the time 
varying volatility of inflation focus on labor market institutions. 
While it is conceivable that labor market institutional factors do play a
 role in wage indexation and bargaining, research on the effects of 
these factors on the volatility of inflation is scant. We therefore 
investigate whether institutional factors with regards to the labor 
market can also explain time variability in the variance of inflation. 
An earlier theoretical work by Attey and De Vries (2011) posits a 
positive relationship between the variance of aggregate wage indexation 
and inflation. By exploiting the relationship between labor market 
institutional factors and the variance of wage indexation, we derive a 
readily testable hypothesis on the link between wage indexation and 
inflation. In order to test the aforementioned hypothesis, we make use 
of panel regression estimation on dataset covering 15 OECD countries 
from 1960 to 2011.  We use volatility estimates obtained from applying a
 GARCH (1, 1) to country specific monthly inflation data as the 
dependent variable. Three groups of labor market institutional variables
 are used in our analysis: proxies for bargaining power, proxies for 
independence of wage bargaining process among unions and proxies for the
 number of unions engaged in wage bargaining process. In addition to 
these variables we do include some variables to control for monetary 
shocks and productivity shocks.

Preliminary results suggest that the institutional variables covering 
bargaining power of unions, independence of unions and number of unions 
engaged in wage bargaining process play significant roles in explaining 
inflation volatility. More specifically, the estimates imply that the 
volatility of inflation is decreasing in the number of independent 
unions involved in the bargaining process and increasing in unions’ 
bargaining power. An intuitive explanation becomes more apparent when 
one considers that the variance of aggregate wage indexation is 
decreasing in the number of individual random wage indexation outcomes, 
thus decreasing volatility of inflation.</div>

 This paper investigates a wide range of plausible determinants of 
international certification (IC) such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 in some 
sub-Saharan African countries (SSA). IC in SSA is largely seen as being 
driven by pressure from international markets and trade relations with 
Western countries. That is, businesses trading with richer countries 
would have a need and/or ability to adopt IC. As a result, as Kaplinksky
 (2010) argues the importance of standards would diminish as exports to 
China grow at the expense of exports to the EU.  In sharp contrast to 
Kaplinksky (2010) the percentage of certifying firms in SSA increased 
from 13% in 2006 to 17.4% in 2011, while SSA’s export share to China 
doubled during the same period. The contribution of this study is to 
examine the relative significance of pressure from international markets
 vis-à-vis other factors in the adoption of IC in SSA. The other factors
 we consider are pressure from international banks and foreign 
investors, pressure from local officials and local community. We also 
control for plant specific capabilities which create opportunities for 
certification. We base our arguments on a combination of the Stakeholder
 Theory, New Institutional Theory and Resource-Based View of the Firm. 
Plant-level data obtained from Enterprise Surveys of the World Bank 2009
 is used to test our hypothesis.&lt;br /&gt;
Our result suggests that international markets are not the only 
determinants for certification in SSA. Besides export orientation, our 
evidence suggests that businesses may certify as a response to pressure 
coming from international banks. International banks may exert a 
coercive as well as mimetic pressure on African businesses, even when 
coercive pressure from international markets is missing. International 
banks, most of which are committed to socially and environmentally 
sustainable practices, may facilitate the diffusion of standards in the 
host country. International banks may also perform 
sustainability-related risk analysis urging customers to demonstrate 
corporate social responsibility. Our result suggests that pressure from 
local sources such as officials and community is relatively weak to push
 businesses towards certification. &lt;br /&gt;
The contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study on 
the plant-level determinants of certification in SSA. We adopt a much 
needed but yet missing micro-level and multilevel approach in addressing
 our research objectives. Furthermore, unlike previous studies we 
theoretical ground and empirically test the role of pressure from 
international banks as a possible factor in driving plants towards 
standardization.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13867_abstract">Abstract:
  The mobilization of tax revenue is crucial for economic and political 
development. If tax mobilization strongly depends upon government 
quality, then a vicious cycle could emerge whereby low tax revenue 
mobilization leads to poor government quality, which leads back to low 
mobilization. The institutions in most African countries are similar in 
nature to that of the formal colonial powers. While Benin and Ghana are 
closer in term of their level of democracy and the quality of 
institutions, Benin and Togo share the same institutional framework 
drawn from the French colonial legacy. Using a data set of over 700 
small-scale firms, we exploit these differences and the proximity of 
these three countries to make cross-border comparisons of the tax and 
business environment in Benin, Ghana and Togo. We find that, across a 
number of dimensions related to tax payments, firms in Benin and Togo 
behave similarly to each other while both differ substantially from 
Ghana. This finding suggests that beyond the quality of the 
institutions, the basic institutional framework and layout may matter 
much as a determinant of several development outcomes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13868_abstract">:
 Gender equality in youth employment is currently one of the greatest 
development challenges facing countries globally, including those in 
Africa. In addition to analyzing the characteristics of gender equality 
in youth employment in Africa, this paper empirically studies the key 
drivers of gender equality in youth employment (proxied by the ratio of 
female youth employment rate to male youth employment rate for the age 
group 15-24 over the period) over the period, 1991 and 2010. Our results
 suggest that for the all-Africa and Sub-Saharan African samples, more 
primary education, quadratic element of real GDP per capita, higher 
youth population, being a Christian country, and higher urban share of 
the population increase gender equality in youth employment while more 
secondary education, higher levels of democracy (and its quadratic 
form), higher level of real GDP per capita, and a net oil-exporting 
country tend to lower it. However, North Africa is different. Apart from
 negative and highly significant North African dummy in the overall 
results, the North African specific sample result indicates that while 
more primary education, and higher levels of democracy increase gender 
equality in youth employment, higher domestic investment rates, higher 
levels of the quadratic form of democracy, and higher youth population, 
and being an oil-exporting country tend to lower gender equality in 
youth employment in the sub-region. The policy implications and lessons 
of these results are discussed. These policies are directed at making 
the African labor market more youth inclusive and hence enhancing female
 youth’s employment for the purpose of greater economic empowerment, 
household welfare and poverty reduction, in particular.</div>

 deserts are increasingly considered as a potential cause of overweight 
and obesity, yet existing literature is largely inconclusive in part due
 to the infeasibility of sorting out multiple confounding mechanisms 
from a purely empirical perspective. This article investigates the 
hypothesized causality in a rational-choice framework, where the 
individual chooses how much to patronize a distant supermarket and/or a 
nearby convenience store, broadly defined, and the weight outcome 
depends on this choice. Results suggest that neither limited supermarket
 access nor low income, the key features of food deserts, would 
determine the weight outcome, which is also affected by individual 
preferences as well as time and monetary costs associated with grocery 
shopping. Parametric conditions under which varying effects on weight 
occur are further derived to elicit policy implications.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14359_abstract">The
 rapid rise in obesity since the 1980s in the United States suggests 
that changes in the commercial food environment that reshape consumer 
behaviors can be more important drivers than genetics. Despite a growing
 attention on neighborhoods with low access to healthy foods, the 
identification of possible effects of food access on obesity has been 
difficult and empirical findings are contradictory at times, possibly 
due to the lack of theoretical foundation, the limitation of data and 
the failure to accurately measure food access. This article helps to 
fill these gaps. We build a household production model with an obesity 
outcome to derive the food purchase decision rules under both budget and
 time constraints, which leads to, and theoretically justifies our 
empirical specification. In addition to the distance to nearest food 
retail outlet that is widely presented in the literature, we utilize 
observed accessibility, which measures the distance the consumer 
actually travels to make food purchases, as well as innovative measures 
of food availability, affordability, and accessibility, to model food 
access with improved accuracy. Construction of these measures are made 
available by the USDA National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase 
Survey (FoodAPS), a newly released data set that we have permission to 
access. We estimate mixed-effects models using a variety of 
specifications to build and validate our findings. The policy 
implications from these results regarding potential mechanisms that 
associate food access and obesity will be able to motivate future 
research investigations and interventions designed to address obesity.</div>

 examine the effect of the food retail environment on consumers’ body 
mass in France, a country that has experienced rising obesity rates in 
the last 15 years. We measure food availability in several ways – number
 of retail outlets, the combined shopping service area, the average 
surface area of retail outlets, as well as the retailer type mix 
expressed as the number of hypermarkets, number of supermarkets, and 
number of small grocery stores. We use a unique panel data set with 
information on body mass of a sample of approximately 1250 individuals 
at two points of time – 2005 and 2010, in the Parisian region. We also 
use different datasets to test the effect of different measures of food 
availability, and different geographic units or reference areas as well 
as different model estimations to test the robustness of our results.  
Our results do not generally suggest systematic or strong influence of 
any of the food environment measures on body mass. However, we robustly 
detect small negative effects of number of small grocery stores and 
small positive effects of number of hypermarkets on body mass.  The 
findings imply that changing the food environment to counter the rise in
 obesity in France may be misguided.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13654_abstract">People
 frequently decide between completing transactions (e.g. paying a bill) 
immediately or in the future. When they opt for the future, the 
transaction may fail: people may forget about it, or external factors 
may get in the way. I show that when such failures are associated with a
 lump-sum cost, this predicts several known departures from the standard
 discounting model: an agent who anticipates such costs will exhibit 
decreasing impatience with dynamic inconsistency; a magnitude effect, 
i.e. discounting large amounts less than small amounts; a reversal of 
this magnitude effect in the loss domain; a sign effect, i.e. 
discounting gains more than losses; and an Andreoni-Sprenger (2012) type
 reduction of discounting and decreasing impatience when money is added 
to existing payoffs. In addition, agents of this type may prefer to 
“pre-crastinate”, i.e. incur losses sooner rather than later. The model 
further predicts a gain-loss asymmetry similar to that which leads to 
loss aversion. The results do not depend on whether the cost arises for 
internal (e.g. forgetting) or external reasons (e.g. “acts of God”), and
 whether the cost of keeping track is incurred every period (e.g. a 
psychological hassle cost) or once (e.g. as a result of forgetting 
combined with a penalty). Naïveté causes agents to behave more like 
standard exponential discounters in most respects, except that it leads 
to a welfare loss when agents choose delayed outcomes because they 
underestimate their cost. Sophisticated agents are willing to pay for 
reminders. Empirical tests confirm that people are likely to fail to act
 on profitable future opportunities, and that they are partly aware of 
this fact, preferring to pre-crastinate on losses and being willing to 
pay for reminders. I discuss applications in development economics, such
 as low takeup of savings technology, water chlorination, vaccination, 
fertilizer, and insurance.</div>

 construct a simple model of preventive health behavior under present 
biased time preferences, and show how beliefs about future time 
preferences (sophistication, partial naivete, and perfect naivete) 
affect how agents are predicted to use, under-use or misuse different 
types of commitment contracts. We propose a type of commitment contract 
that has the potential to benefit not just sophisticated present biased 
agents, but also naifs. We conduct a field experiment focused on 
increasing the share of patients who actively manage their hypertension

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13657_abstract">High
 levels of alcohol consumption are more common among the poor. This fact
 could have economic consequences beyond mere income effects because 
alcohol impairs mental processes and decision-making. Since alcohol is 
thought to induce myopia, this paper tests for impacts on self-control 
and on savings behavior. In a three-week field experiment with 
low-income workers in India, I provided 229 individuals with a 
high-return savings opportunity and randomized incentives for sobriety. 
The incentives significantly reduced daytime drinking as measured by 
decreased breathalyzer scores. This in turn increased savings by 
approximately 60 percent. No more than half of this effect is explained 
by changes in income net of alcohol expenditures. In addition, 
consistent with enhanced self-control due to lower inebriation levels, 
incentivizing sobriety reduced the impact of a savings commitment 
device. Finally, alcohol consumption itself is prone to self-control 
problems: over half of the study participants were willing to sacrifice 
money to receive incentives to be sober, exhibiting demand for 
commitment to increase their sobriety. These findings suggest that heavy
 alcohol consumption is not just a result of self-control problems, but 
also creates self-control problems in other areas, potentially even 
exacerbating poverty by reducing savings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10679_abstract">When
 permitted by law, employers sometimes state the preferred age and sex 
of their employees in job ads.  We extend Kuhn and Shen’s (2013) study 
of this practice to three new samples of job ads from China and Mexico, 
focusing on the interaction between firms’ age and gender preferences. 
In all four data sets, we find that both age and gender profiling become
 less common as job skill requirements rise (the "negative 
skill-targeting relationship").  Also, firms' explicit gender requests 
shift dramatically away from women and towards men when firms are 
seeking older (as opposed to younger) workers (the "age twist" in gender
 preferences). Some, but not all of this twist can be attributed to 
employers’ age-dependent demands for female beauty and male leadership. 
Gender differences in firms’ marital status preferences also appear to 
play a role.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10680_abstract">We
 test whether recessions exacerbate routine-biased technological change 
(RBTC), whereby firms replace routine-task workers with machines and 
hire more skilled workers to operate them, accelerating the job 
polarization of the U.S. labor market. In doing so we establish a new 
fact about the demand for skill over the business cycle. Using a new 
database containing the near-universe of electronic job vacancy postings
 in U.S. metro areas over the period 2007 and 2010-2015, we find 
evidence of upskilling -- firms demanding more skilled workers when 
local employment growth is slower. Our estimates imply that, across all 
types of jobs, firms demand roughly an extra two-thirds of a year more 
experience and are 50% more likely to ask for a college degree in a 
large recession compared to a boom. We find that the vast majority of 
these effects can be attributed to changes in skill requirements for the
 same firms and the same occupations, with only small roles for shifting
 distributions of the firms that hire and the occupations they ask for. 
We propose upskilling is driven primarily by firm restructuring of 
production towards more-skilled workers. We show that (1) upskilling is 
persistent after local economies recover from the Great Recession and 
this elevated skill demand is driven by the same firms that upskilled 
early in the recovery; (2) among publicly traded firms in our data, 
those that upskill more also increase capital stock by more over the 
same time period, and (3) upskilling is concentrated within routine-task
 occupations -- those most vulnerable to RBTC. We also rule out a number
 of other cyclical explanations for upskilling. For example, we see 
little evidence that firms opportunistically seek to hire more skilled 
workers in a slack labor market. We thus present the first direct 
evidence that the Great Recession exacerbated technological change.</div>

 paper evaluates the effects of capital controls on firm-level stock 
returns and real investment using data from Brazil. Theory suggests that
 the imposition of capital controls can drive up the cost of capital and
 curb investment. Credit constraints are also more likely to bind for 
firms that are more dependent on external finance. The data suggest that
 there is a significant decline in cumulative abnormal returns for 
Brazilian firms following the imposition of capital controls in 
2008-2009 consistent with an increase in the cost of capital. 
Conditioning on firm-characteristics such as firm size and export 
status, the data suggest that large firms and the largest exporting 
firms are less affected by the controls. Firms that are more dependent 
on external finance are however more adversely affected by the controls.
 The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that capital controls 
increase market uncertainty and reduce the availability of external 
finance, which in turn lowers investment at the firm-level.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12925_abstract">In
 the aftermath of the global financial crisis, a new policy paradigm has
 emerged in which old-fashioned policies such as capital controls and 
other government distortions have become part of the standard policy 
tool kit (so called macroprudential policies). On the wave of this 
seemingly unanimous policy consensus, a new strand of theoretical 
literature contends that capital controls are welfare enhancing and can 
be justified rigorously because of second-best considerations. Within 
the same theoretical framework adopted in this fast-growing literature, 
this paper shows that a credible commitment to support the exchange rate
 in crisis times always welfare-dominates prudential capital controls,

 present an overlapping generations model of early-life parental 
investment and later-life own investment in health. The parent optimizes
 her own consumption, leisure time, time devoted to work and child 
investment, health, and the duration of her longevity, subject to the 
constraints she faces in terms of the initial own and the child’s health
 endowment, the resources at her disposition, the own and child

health-capital production processes. Such interaction between child and 
adult health has not been addressed in the extant human development, 
labor or health literatures. The model is able to reproduce several 
empirical patterns documented in the literature, such as the early 
emergence and widening of health disparities across the life cycle, and 
the accelerated aging experienced by those born in poverty. The model 
also generates sharp predictions about the health effects of permanent

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13012_abstract">Cesarean
 delivery accounts for nearly one-third of all births in the U.S. and 
contributes to an additional $38 billion in healthcare costs each year. 
 Although Cesarean delivery has a long record of improving maternal and 
neonatal mortality and morbidity, increased utilization over time has 
yielded public health concerns and calls for reductions. Studies have 
linked Cesarean delivery to increased maternal postpartum weight and 
decreased subsequent fertility, which may have significant implications 
for the obesity epidemic and population-level fertility rates.  Previous
 literature, however, typically does not address selection biases 
stemming from correlations between pre-pregnancy weight and health and 
Cesarean delivery.  In this study, we rely on fetal malpresentation as a
 largely exogenous factor that explains Cesarean delivery but is 
uncorrelated with pre-pregnancy weight or health, using hospital 
administrative data (including vital records fields) from the state of 
WI from 2006 to 2013. In comparing  mothers who deliver via Cesarean due
 to fetal malpresentation to mothers who deliver vaginally, we find no 
evidence that Cesarean delivery leads to greater maternal postpartum 
weight retention. Instead, we find that Cesarean mothers weigh about ¾ 
of a pound more at the start of their second pregnancy relative to their
 vaginal delivery counterparts. However, we find a negative effect of 
Cesarean delivery on subsequent fertility, with an 11.4 percent 
reduction in the likelihood of subsequent childbearing following 
Cesarean delivery, relative to vaginal births. These findings inform 
prenatal counseling policies to improve the decision-making process 
between the woman and her clinician, especially in low-risk pregnancies 
where vaginal delivery might be an option.</div>

 paper examines the relationship between parents’ access to family 
planning, their children’s economic outcomes in adulthood, and their 
grandchildren’s resources in childhood. Using the county-level 
introduction of U.S. family planning programs from 1964 to 1973 and 
linked 2000-2013 Census/ACS data, we find that children born in the 5 
years after family planning programs began (relative to children born in
 the five years before) had higher incomes, educations, and were less 
likely to be the single-heads of household. A bounding exercise suggests
 that selection can account for around one third of these gains in adult
 outcomes, attributing a sizable share of the improvements to changes in
 parenting and early childhood environment. A second analysis suggests 
these benefits advantage grandchildren as well. The children of parents 
born in the five years after family planning programs (the grandchildren
 of parents’ gaining access to family planning) had incomes that were 10
 percent higher than children born to parents born before family 
planning began. These results imply that family planning programs have 
significant long-run and intergenerational effects and economic returns 
that exceed those of other investments in children’s human capital.</div>

 United States is the only developed nation without paid parental leave.
 There are, however, four states – California, Rhode Island, Washington,
 and New Jersey – that do have laws providing paid family leave for 
employees who need time off to care for a new child. This paper 
evaluates the impacts of state-level paid family leave policies on 
infant mortality in the United States. I rely on both across-state and 
within-state variation under the presumption that employees residing in 
counties with lower levels of education and income are less likely to 
have access to paid leave through their employer, less likely to afford 
to take unpaid time off following the birth of a child, and thus more 
likely to benefit from the PFL programs. Using Vital Statistics Linked 
Births/Infant Death Certificate data from 2000-2012, preliminary results
 suggest state-level paid parental leave policies decreased infant 
mortality rates. The effects are stronger in counties with lower levels 
of education. The results of this study have important implications for 
the increasing dialogue surrounding family leave.</div>

 model the saving problem of retired couples and singles facing

social insurance. Households can save to self-insure against uncertain 
longevity and medical expenses, and to leave bequests. Individuals in a 
couple can be altruistic towards their spouse and other heirs and split 
bequests optimally. Single people can care about leaving bequests to 
children and others. Using AHEAD data, we first estimate the model and

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13190_abstract">Understanding
 why and when individuals retire is central to the current debate on 
pension reform. We study how women change their employment decisions in 
response to a Swiss reform that increased the full retirement age (FRA) 
twice, from 62 to 63 years, and from 63 years to 64 years, by date of 
birth. We find that raising the FRA strongly affects women's labor 
supply. A one year increase in the FRA delays labor market exit by 7.9 
months and claiming of retirement benefits by 6.6 months. We neither 
find an effect on labor supply nor on benefit claiming of affected 
women's spouses. Mortality increases somewhat but the effect is not 
precisely estimated. Increasing the FRA has no statistically significant
 effect on the level of social security benefits but lowers social 
security wealth. Increasing the FRA by two years reduces the present 
discounted cost of a retiree by 10%.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13191_abstract">Increasing
 individual working lives to counter population ageing and public 
pension deficits is of utmost interest to policy makers today. Because 
over 70 per cent of older individuals live in a couple, it is relevant 
to investigate spouses’ retirement strategies. Earlier literature in 
this area focused on spousal participation decision. Here we exploit the
 law on retirement age in France together with an unexpected pension 
policy reform to identify the effect of a spouse’s retirement 
(instrumented with legal retirement age) on the other spouse’s labor 
supply, accounting also for hours responses. The sample for the analysis
 includes several thousand French couples over the last decade and 
within one year of the age cutoff.  The individual retirement 
probability increases significantly, by about 0.25-0.30, at legal 
retirement age, thus supporting our identification strategy.  We 
conclude that the husband’s retirement probability increases 
significantly, though slightly, by about 0.02, upon retirement of the 
wife but the wife’s retirement probability does not respond to the 
husband’s retirement.  In contrast, own hours of market work drop 
significantly and roughly by about two hours per week upon spousal 
retirement and this holds true for both the husband and the wife.</div>

 a difference-in-differences methodology, we estimate the impact of 
increasing the early retirement age for women on the labor force 
participation of their husbands. We exploit a recent increase of the 
early retirement age from 60 to 61 for women (with no change for men) in
 the UK to identify the effect of later retirement among women on the 
labor force participation of their husbands. Our results suggest that in
 response to the reform employment rates of married women increased by 
5.4 percentage points at age 60, while the employment rate of their 
husbands rose by 4.2 percentage points. We also find that the proportion
 of couples where both partners work rose by 5.4 percentage points – 
higher than expected if partners’ labor supply were  substitutes for one
 another or were independent decisions. Our results therefore provide 
evidence of joint retirement caused by complementarities of leisure

 find that outstanding bank loans are vital for the transmission of 
monetary policy because, unlike other debt, most bank loans have 
floating rates that are mechanically tied to monetary policy rates. This
 novel floating rate channel is potentially as important as the widely 
studied bank lending channel through new loans. Firms that use more bank
 debt and do not hedge it display a stronger sensitivity of their stock 
price, profitability, cash holdings, and inventory investment to 
monetary policy. The effect is more powerful for financially constrained
 firms, consistent with the idea that changes to floating rates induced 
by monetary policy have an impact on the liquidity of these firms. 
Moreover, this effect disappears when policy rates hit the zero lower 
bound, revealing a new limitation of unconventional monetary policy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11635_abstract">In
 the Great Recession, regions of the United States that experienced the 
largest declines in household debt to income also experienced the 
largest drops in consumption and employment. We develop a search and 
matching model that reproduces such patterns. Tighter debt constraints 
raise workers' and firms' discount rates, thus reducing match surplus, 
vacancy creation, and employment. Two ingredients of our model, 
on-the-job human capital accumulation and worker debt constraints, 
greatly amplify the drop in employment. On-the-job human capital 
accumulation implies that the returns to posting a vacancy are 
backloaded: the surplus from a match is thus more sensitive to changes 
in firm discount rates. Worker debt constraints amplify these effects 
further by preventing wages from falling too much. We show that the 
model reproduces the salient cross-sectional features of the U.S. data, 
including the comovement between consumption, house prices, 
debt-to-income as well as tradable and non-tradable employment.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12052_abstract">This
 paper develops a chained mortgage contracts model where both homeowner 
consumers and the financial institutions that securitize their mortgage 
loan are credit-constrained. The presence of financial frictions in both
 the consumer and the financial sectors brings the model closer to real 
financial markets and demonstrates the role of risk sharing between 
leveraged borrowers. Highly leveraged banks act as financial 
intermediaries in the mortgage contract so when a negative disturbance 
worsens their indebtedness, they transfer some of the downturn to 
indebted consumers who have no financial recourse outside of the chained
 loan contracts. The leverage of homeowner households experiences a 
smaller worsening than in the single loan contract model since 
households share the deterioration of the debt position with banks but 
their downturn is more protracted. This consequence is observed both 
after a housing oversupply shock and a relaxation of borrowing 
conditions but is especially evident following relaxed credit access for
 banks. After initially raising their leverage in response to the lax 
borrowing conditions, financial institutions repair their debt position 
relatively fast at the expense of consumers whose borrowing ability is 
squeezed although they are not the source of the disturbance. The result
 mirrors the recent subprime mortgage crisis characterized by a sharp 
but brief decline for banks and a protracted recovery for mortgaged 
households.</div>

 attempt to explain two stylized facts of the Great Recession, namely 
the build-up of high leverage in the household sector in the boom phase,
 deep busts and protracted recovery as rare systemic events. We extend 
Boz and Mendoza (2014) by explicitly modeling the credit markets and 
modifying the learning to an adaptive set-up. We find that in such a 
set-up, the build-up of leverage and the collateral price cycles take 
longer than in other DSGE models with financial frictions. The boom-bust
 cycles occur as rare events, with two systemic crises per century. The 
model also replicates asymmetric distributions of key macroeconomic and 
financial variables, with high skewness and fat tails. In addition, we 
show that a simple LTV-cap regulation is effective in smoothing the 
leverage cycles by limiting household borrowing in upturns, both via 
quantity (higher equity participation requirement) and price (lower 
collateral value) effects, as well as providing a well defined anchor

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13179_abstract">Financing
 through crowdfunding is growing rapidly, especially for start-ups. 
Investment financing via crowdfunding is integrated with the real side 
of the firm as future consumers may potentially provide all or part of 
the required resources. Some crowdfunding platforms allow for contracts 
where the monopolist commits to execute the project only if a funding 
target is met. Consumers therefore must consider whether they are 
pivotal in the successful financing and initiation of production. We 
find that an optimal crowdfunding contract, which specifies a pre-sale 
price and a funding target, may serve as a price discrimination 
mechanism by forcing pivotal consumers to pay a premium above the 
expected future spot price. Thus, even in the absence of financing 
constraints, the monopolist benefits from funding her investment via the
 crowdfunding platform. Moreover pre-sale crowdfunding increases 
expected production and total welfare when the marginal c ost of p 
roduction is low, as in high-technology firms. When entrepreneurs are 
financially constrained, and their projects are fundable via pre-sale 
crowdfunding, higher external financing costs increase total surplus as 
long as production takes place. This indicates that reducing the cost of
 capital, a common policy instrument used for spurring innovation, may 
unintentionally reduce welfare. Finally, equity crowdfunding can result 
in over-priced equity valuation, in contrast to the equity underpricing 
in IPOs.</div>

 asymmetry presents a challenge to equity crowdfunding just as in other

syndicates reduce market failures caused by information asymmetry by

lead investors. Syndicates align incentives of issuers, lead and follow 
on investors by providing incentives for lead investors to conduct due 
diligence, monitor progress, and exploit their reputation. We report

 platforms enable the financing of projects by soliciting small 
investments from a large base of potential backers over the Internet. 
These platforms create a dynamic funding network. We use data collected 
from Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, to study some of 
the dynamics of such a network. We focus on project owners who choose to
 operate on both sides of the market, creating campaigns of their own as
 well as backing the projects of others. We find that an owner’s 
backing-history has a significant effect on financing outcomes. 
Campaigns initiated by entrepreneurs who have previously supported 
others have higher success rates, attract more backers and collect more 
funds. Moreover, playing both sides of the market has a causal effect 
leading to increased crowdfunding success. We also provide evidence as 
to the existence of reciprocity. Project owners back their backers, when
 possible, at a rate that is hundreds of time higher than that which 
they award other comparable projects. We quantify the impact of owner 
backings on the performance of crowdfunding platforms and campaigns. Our

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10462_abstract">The
 global financial crisis (GFC), as well as the more recent taper 
tantrum, has served as rude reminders of the dangers associated with 
large capital inflows and subsequent sudden stops in emerging market 
economies (EMEs). But perhaps more importantly, it has reaffirmed the 
importance of domestic macroeconomic and financial conditions in 
determining the impact of global shocks on these economies: while most 
EMEs experienced a surge in capital inflows in the runup to the GFC, not
 all of them experienced a financial crisis when global economic winds 
shifted. But which domestic factors are important in determining the 
post-surge outcome? That is the question we explore in this paper. A 
burgeoning literature examines the importance and determinants of 
capital flows to EMEs. Following the EME crises of the 1990s, a large 
number of studies have also emerged on the factors associated with 
sudden stops and crisis occurrence, which generally find a strong 
association between large capital inflows, and the subsequent onset of 
financial crises. But while existing studies highlight the risks 
associated with inflow surges, they tend to overlook the fact that 
countries do not experience inflow surges for the same duration, nor do 
they all ultimately experience a crisis. In fact, despite experiencing 
large capital inflows along with East Asian EMEs in mid-1990s, much of 
Latin America was spared full blown crises at the time of the Asian 
financial crisis. Similarly, while emerging Europe suffered during the 
GFC, Asia and Latin America weathered the crisis relatively well. This 
paper thus investigates two key questions using data for 50 EMEs over 
1970-2013: first, what factors determine how long surge episodes last? 
And second, why do some surge episodes end in a crash landing (defined 
as a sudden and large reversal of capital flows), while others do not?</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10461_abstract">A
 considerable literature has examined the causes, consequences, and 
policy responses to surges in international capital flows. A related 
strand of papers has attempted to systematically catalog current account
 reversals and capital account “sudden stops.” However, the frame of 
empirical reference tends to be narrow, most often employing data over 
the post-Bretton Woods period with an emphasis on advanced economies. We
 gather together observations from a myriad of sources to create a 
unique longer-run dataset on the current account relative to GDP for 
advanced and emerging market economies, with some of the time series 
starting in the early 1800s. In the event, global factors—such as 
commodity prices, international interest rates, and growth in the 
world’s largest economies—have a systematic effect on the capital flow 
cycle. Building on earlier work, we refine this by identifying capital 
inflow bonanzas, or episodes of outsized current account deficits 
relative to a country’s own history. Bonanzas are no blessing for 
advanced or emerging market economies. In the case of the latter, 
capital inflow bonanzas are associated with a higher likelihood of 
economic crises (debt defaults, banking, inflation and currency 
crashes); in addition, bonanzas are associated with procyclical fiscal 
policies and attempts to curb or avoid an exchange rate 
appreciation—very likely contributing to economic vulnerability. For the
 advanced economies, bonanzas are associated with more volatile 
macroeconomic outcomes for GDP growth, inflation, and the external 
accounts, and lower economic growth. Of particular interest is the 
common component in swings in the incidence of bonanzas and commodity 
prices.</div>

 use micro data from European Social Survey that include information on 
labor force participation and hours worked of second-generation 
immigrants who reside in 26 European countries.  These individuals are 
born in Europe, and they have been exposed to institutional, legal and

The fathers of these individuals are first-generation immigrants and we 
identify 81 different countries they migrated from. We construct 
measures of “taste for leisure” in the country of origin of each 
immigrant father.  We use two different tax measures (average and 
marginal) for each country and control for individual characteristics 
such age, education, marital status, size of the city and ethnic 
minority status.  We also control for a set of attributes of the country
 of residence and country of origin.  Thus, we are able to identify the 
impact of taxes on labor supply (both at the extensive and intensive 
margin), holding constant observable attributes of individuals, various 
attributes of the country in which they live, and attributes of their 
father’s country of origin, including the taste for leisure in that 
country of origin.  Similarly, we can identify the impact of culture of 
leisure on labor supply, holding constant personal characteristics, and 
country attributes, including taxes.   The results show that for women, 
both taxes and culture of leisure impact participation and hours worked.
  For men, taxes influence labor supply both at the intensive and the 
extensive margin, but culture of leisure has no impact.</div>

 document the implications of missing women in the short and long run. 
We exploit a natural historical experiment, which sent large numbers of 
male convicts and far fewer female convicts to Australia in the 18th and
 19th century. In areas with higher gender imbalance, women historically
 married more, had more children, and were less likely to occupy 
high-rank occupations. Today, people living in those areas have more 
conservative attitudes towards women working and women are less likely 
to have high-ranking occupations. We discuss how these norms were 
beneficial historically, but are no longer necessarily so. The 
underlying mechanism we propose is that cultural norms can serve 
reproductive fitness but may harm overall fitness in the long run. 
Historical gender imbalance is associated with an aggregate income loss 
estimated at $800 per year, per person. Our results are robust to a wide
 array of geographic, historical and present-day controls, including 
migration and state fixed effects, and to instrumenting the overall sex

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11624_abstract">A
 recent literature has focused on gender differences in asking for 
higher salaries as a substantial culprit of gender differences in wages.
 In this paper we provide an experiment where workers, after learning 
their contribution to the joint firm-worker profit, receive a random 
wage offer which is on average lower than the workers' contribution. 
Workers then decide whether to accept this wage offer, or whether they 
want to enter a negotiation with the firm. We find that women are 
significantly less likely to enter negotiations than men, even though 
women who enter negotiations have significantly positive returns from 
doing so. This may lead to the expected conclusion and the 
recommendation that women don't ask and should ask more often. In the 
laboratory, we can assess the counter-factual: what would happen if all 
women were forced to negotiate? We find that the additional women who 
now enter negotiations have significant negative returns from asking. 
Women were positively selecting into asking: those that were good at it,
 did so already. Therefore, when workers know what they bring to the 
table, this study highlights the costs of leaning in.</div>

 of appropriate incentives is an important attribute of leadership, yet 
little is known about the mechanisms behind selection and perception of 
different types of incentivization methods. This study uses a laboratory
 experiment to characterize the ways in which leaders assign incentives 
in order to encourage costly effort from workers. This study also yields
 insights into the effect of the leader’s gender on the choice of 
incentives, the impact of incentives on worker productivity, and 
subsequent evaluation of this choice by third‐party observers. 
Specifically, in the first part of the experiment, we test whether 
gender and other individual characteristics explain the likelihood of 
selecting positive (“carrot”) or negative (“stick”) types of incentive 
schemes. Furthermore, we estimate the extent to which incentive schemes 
and the gender of the leader affect worker productivity. In the second 
part of the experiment we reveal the choices of the leaders to third 
party evaluators who rate the leader’s competency and vote on whether or
 not to apply the given leader’s choices to their own payoffs. By 
varying the information about the leader’s gender we are able to 
identify the effect gender may have on the perception of the selected 
incentivization methods. We hypothesize that women make use of different
 incentive methods, that these methods will affect workers differently 
depending on the gender of the leader, and that women leaders will be 
less likely to receive a positive evaluation. Furthermore, we 
hypothesize women leaders choosing negative incentives may be underrated
 relative to men choosing the same incentives, as well as relative to 
the women choosing positive incentives.</div>

 occupy few of the top positions in business, government and academics 
and have average earnings that are a fraction of men’s. Positions that 
pay well tend to require negotiation skills to get the job and to 
perform well on the job. These skills also help to realize economic 
opportunities throughout life. On average, studies have found that women
 were less likely to enter a negotiation than men and they obtained 
worse negotiated outcomes in a variety of settings. Most of the results 
are based on face-to-face negotiations in hypothetical or low-payoff 
consequence environments. With the myriad of acceptable forms of 
communication available (e.g. online written messages, text chat, phone 
calls, video, face to face), it is unclear if differences in negotiation
 would remain when gender cues and expectations are mitigated or 
eliminated with less socially rich interactions. This research uses 
economic experiments to delve into gender differences in negotiation by 
systematically examining the effects of communication mode (e.g. 
anonymous written message, audio, face to face) on negotiated outcomes 
in a payoff-relevant setting. The research will inform what aspects of 
the negotiation environment are most conducive for mutually-beneficial 
agreements. Small changes in the negotiation environment might result in
 large gains in economic outcomes across groups and individuals.</div>

 are often less willing than men to compete, even in tasks where there 
is no gender gap in performance. Also, many people experience 
competitive contexts as stressful and previous research has documented 
that men and women sometimes react differently to acute stressors. We 
use two laboratory experiments to investigate whether factors related to
 stress can help explain the gender gap in competitiveness. Experiment 1
 studies whether stress responses (measured with salivary cortisol and 
through self-assessment) to taking part in a mandatory competition 
predict individual willingness to participate in a voluntary 
competition. We find that while the mandatory competition does increase 
stress levels, there is no gender difference in this reaction. Cortisol 
response does not predict willingness to compete for men but is 
positively and significantly correlated with choosing to enter the 
voluntary competition for women. In Experiment 2 we exogenously induce 
physiological stress using the cold-pressor task. We find no causal 
effect of stress on competitiveness for the sample as a whole and only 
tentative evidence of a positive effect for women. In summary, even 
though there are some gender differences in the relation between stress 
responses and the decision to enter a competition or not, these cannot 
explain the general gender gap in willingness to compete that is 
generally found in the literature and which we replicate. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12802_abstract">The
 effect of college selectivity on graduates' long-run outcomes is at the
 center of several literatures. The literature on college access 
presumes that the effect is positive, and that policy should aim to move
 (qualified) disadvantaged students into more selective schools. But the
 literature on potential mismatch effects of affirmative action presumes
 the opposite, that students will thrive when their preparedness 
resembles that of their classmates. Unfortunately, credible evidence 
about the effect of selectivity is quite thin. We use variation in 
college selectivity induced by the Texas Ten Percent Plan, together with
 matched data tracking students from high school through to the labor 
market, to identify the causal effect of attending a flagship state 
university on adult employment outcomes. The Ten Percent Plan meant that
 many students were admitted to the University of Texas at Austin (UT) 
from high schools that previously sent few graduates. These students 
were less qualified than the typical UT matriculant on observable 
dimensions. If mismatch effects are important, they would have done less
 well than in the pre-policy regime, where weak students from "feeder" 
schools would have done better; positive selectivity effects imply the 
opposite. We use a differences-in-differences design to distinguish 
these hypotheses.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12803_abstract">The
 vast education and earnings literature emphasizes heterogeneity in “the
 return” to college.  But “the return” is not a fixed person-specific 
parameter. It is influenced by choices over major and study effort.   
Many factors influence these choices.  In this paper, we examine the 
role of liquidity constraints.

Why would liquidity constraints affect the return? College students must
 cover not only educational expenses but also living costs and other 
financial obligations while in school.  As a result, many students hold 
jobs, and must balance study time against time in the labor market.  The
 amount of time a student can spend on course work influences 
performance. Furthermore, some fields, such as engineering, have more 
prerequisites and require more credits than others.  Given constraints 
on time and energy, this sets up a potential tradeoff between student 
earnings and human capital accumulation.  A student’s choices will 
depend on liquidity constraints.

In this paper, we provide theory and evidence on the effects of 
financial need on student employment, college major, grades, and 
earnings.  On the theory side, we use a series of simple models to show 
that under reasonable assumptions students who are under more financial 
pressure while in college will work more in the labor market, study 
less, take less demanding majors, get lower grades conditional on the 
major chosen, take longer to complete school, and earn less.  The 
empirical analysis uses rich administrative data on Florida high school 
students who attended in-state public colleges and universities, which 
includes transcript information, financial aid information, and 
quarterly earnings during and after college.  We use the data to study 
the connections among financial need, market work while in school, 
credit hours per semester, time to degree, grades, and field of 
study.&lt;br /&gt;</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12804_abstract">A
 number of states have recently prohibited the use of affirmative action
 in admissions to public universities.  A growing body of research 
suggests that these affirmative action bans reduce minority enrollment 
at selective colleges while leaving overall minority college enrollment 
rates unchanged. The effects of the bans on segregation within and 
across colleges are theoretically ambiguous and have not yet been 
directly estimated.

This paper uses variation in the timing of affirmative action bans 
across states to estimate their effects on racial segregation, as 
measured by exposure and dissimilarity indexes.  The results suggest 
that affirmative action bans can actually reduce racial segregation 
across colleges.  The reason is that there is a U-shaped relationship 
between measures of college quality and the share of the student body 
who are members of underrepresented minority groups.  Affirmative action
 bans (such as the one that went into effect in California in 1998) have
 in some cases flattened out this U shape, thereby contributing to a 
decline in measured segregation.  This finding is notable because the 
Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action is constitutional on the
 grounds that there are educational benefits to racial diversity, 
despite the fact that an increase in diversity at one university may 
come at the expense of a decrease in diversity at another university and
 possibly even an overall increase in segregation across universities.</div>

 estimate an equilibrium model of grading policies where professors set 
both an intercept and a returns to studying and ability. Professors 
value enrollment, learning, and student study time and set their 
policies taking into the account the policies of the other professors. 
Students respond to grading policies in their selection of courses and 
how much to study conditional on enrolling. Men and women are allowed to
 have different preferences over course types, the benefits associated 
with higher grades, and the cost of exerting more effort. Two 
decompositions are performed. First, we separate out how much of the 
differences in grading policies across fields is driven by differences 
in demand for courses in those fields and how much is due to differences
 in professor preferences across fields. Second, we separate out 
differences in female/male course taking across fields is driven by i) 
differences in cognitive skills, ii) differences in the  valuation of 
grades, iii) differences in the cost of studying, and iv) differences in
 field preferences. We then use the structural parameters to evaluate 
restrictions on grading policies. Restrictions on grading policies that 
equalize grade distributions across classes result in higher (lower) 
grades in science (nonscience) fields but more (less) work being 
required. As women value grades more than men and find studying less 
costly, this restriction on grading policies results in more women 
pursuing the sciences and more men pursuing the nonsciences.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14052_abstract">Music
 is an important part of life for many college students, and the 
incorporation of music in the classroom provides a way to teach and 
illustrate economic concepts that makes learning fun and relevant.  This
 presentation includes proven methods from great instructors as well as 
original ideas of the author, forming a compendium of effective ways to 
utilize the power of music to capture student attention and convey 
economic concepts.  
One successful method of teaching economics through music is to play the
 music before class begins, ideally with the lyrics and economic content
 or commentary appearing on the screen simultaneously.  This introduces 
economic concepts and focuses student attention in the minutes leading 
up to the start of class without sacrificing actual classroom time.  
Use of music lyrics during class lecture or discussion can provide 
creative examples of economic principles and evidence of the universal 
presence and relevance of economics.  
Cognizant of the opportunity cost of minutes spent playing entire songs,
 the author has experimented with the use of very short clips embedded 
into classroom presentations.  This utilizes the power of the music to 
make the concept relevant with minimal time cost.  These short clips 
provide a kind of mental “hook” on which students can attach 
understanding of specific economic principles.  
Student projects that include the identification and explication of 
economic concepts in music of the student’s choice empowers students to 
find and explain economics where they may never have thought about it 
before.  This project can be implemented as a written paper or a video 
presentation.  
Others have asked students to create a music video that essentially 
parodies an existing song using original lyrics that utilize and explain
 economics ideas.  This has proven to be an especially enjoyable and 
worthwhile experience for students.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14053_abstract">For
 many our first endeavor into the world of business is the lemonade 
stand at the end of the driveway and the first key decision is what to 
charge for a glass of lemonade.  A nickel, a dime, or a dollar?   The 
price will make or break the business -- charge too much and no one will
 buy your lemonade; charge too little and you will not have enough. Our 
business education starts at a much earlier age.  Children’s literature 
is ripe with economic metaphors and references to business.  Farmer Boy 
teaches children about sustainability, while The Lorax forces us to 
consider how business activity interacts with environmental concerns.   
In this paper, we discuss our team-teaching of a first year program 
course that combined an introduction to children’s literature with the 
study of core economic concepts.  Specifically we focus on three course 
projects:  a workshop on the use of marketing in Charlotte’s Web; an 
analysis of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as an allegory for the 
bi-metalism debate of the 1890s; and a group data analysis exercise 
culminating in a visual depiction of the possible choices a character 
faced on the basis of several economic factors in Lyddie.</div>

 we know, technology is the process we choose for transforming a set of 
quantitative and qualitative factors of production into one or more 
outcomes.  In teaching economics, we most often describe this as a 
process of transforming inputs such as student and teacher effort, 
textbooks, and Powerpoint slides into student learning outcomes.  The 
purpose of this paper is to consider the promise of humanities as 
technology in the teaching of the principles of economics.  Three 
examples of employing humanities as technology are discussed.  First, 
instructors might design examination questions that give students the 
opportunity to prepare responses in the form of one-act plays that are 
situated in the context of the work students would most wish to engage 
upon graduation, and that mimic the job interviews for which they are 
preparing.  Second, we might ask students to prepare term papers in 
which they discover principles of economics in poetry or paintings.  
Third, instructors might feature philosophical tracts such as Plato’s 
Republic or David Hume’s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding as 
platforms for discussing a number of economic principles.  These 
“technologies” arguably make learning economics more interesting and 
more permanent for students than would otherwise be the case.  Such 
technologies could make teaching economics more interesting for faculty,
 as they help make teaching a course that one may teach a number of 
times over the years nevertheless different each term.  And the 
technologies enable economies of scope, which is valuable since we have 
such a short time to both teach the economic principles and to help 
impart a compelling general/liberal education.</div>

 is a large literature linking firm structure to performance measures 
such as growth and profitability. We discuss and analyze its 
implications for a firm’s workers. The relationship is theoretically 
ambiguous: decentralized organization may empower local managers to 
improve worker conditions (potentially to the firm’s benefit), while 
centralization may allow for better adherence to labor regulation. We 
examine this relationship in the context of worker safety in China, 
where we document a strong negative relationship between a measure of 
local management autonomy and worker fatalities.</div>

 document that group affiliated firms display less pronounced 
fluctuations in employment than unaffiliated firms following changes in 
the business cycle. These results cannot be traced back to differences 
in the sensitivity of profitability, sales or asset growth to changes in
 the business cycle. They are instead consistent with the presence of 
internal labor markets. In particular, the results are more pronounced 
in countries in which labor mobility is facilitated by less stringent 
labor regulations. In these countries, workers appear to move from less 
profitable to more profitable group affiliated firms. The results are 
robust to a battery of endogeneity tests. Importantly, the evidence 
indicates a new “bright side” of group affiliation: less job

 corporate political connections are known to enhance firm values, we

We examine the consequences of a recent state law in Australia that 
restricts union political activity, but does not change collective 
bargaining
rights. In the wake of this law, the values of affected unionized firms 
significantly increase and, consistent with this market reaction, these 
firms are subsequently able to negotiate more favorable labor contracts

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12289_abstract">We
 provide evidence that French business groups rely on Internal Labor 
Markets (ILMs) to respond to shocks calling for labor adjustments that 
are costly to perform in frictional external labor markets. ILM activity
 is higher in more diversified groups, where affiliated firms are more 
likely to be subject to unrelated shocks. Adverse shocks leading to 
closures and mass layoffs in affiliated firms trigger ILM activity, 
boosting the proportion of separating workers redeployed to 
group-affiliated partners as opposed to external labor market partners. 
This effect is stronger when the shock hits a firm subject to more 
stringent employment protection regulation, and thus higher firing 
costs. We also find that ILMs operate differently for different 
occupations: adverse shocks trigger most markedly the ILM for blue 
collars, for whom firing costs and union pressure are large, while the 
ILM for high-skill occupations is the most active in "normal times". 
Finally, we find that upon closure events the ILM reallocates displaced 
employees more intensely to groups units that are more efficient and 
enjoy better growth opportunities, and less intensely to highly levered 
and financially distressed units. Overall, our evidence supports the 
claim that Internal Labor Markets emerge as a co-insurance mechanism 
across group-affiliated firms, providing job stability to groups' 
employees as a by-product.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12431_abstract">Using a rich data set on government spending forecasts, we estimate the effects of unexpected
government spending both when the nominal interest rate is near zero lower bound (ZLB) and
outside of the ZLB period in Japan. The output multiplier is 1.5 on impact in the ZLB period,
while it is 0.7 outside of the ZLB period. We estimate that the government spending shocks
increase both private consumption and investment during the ZLB period but crowd them out
in the normal period. The unemployment rate decreases in the ZLB period, while it does not
respond significantly during the normal period. We argue that these results are not driven by
the amount of slack in the economy. We estimate a positive but mild inflation response in both
periods. A calibrated standard New Keynesian model with a fundamental-driven ZLB period
can match our empirical findings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12432_abstract">The
 papers shows that the effects of a shift in fiscal policy on the 
economy should be estimated recognizing that fiscal policy is not 
implemented through isolated "shocks", rather through multi-year plans. 
Such plans, that typically extend over a three-year horizon, contain 
unanticipated shifts in fiscal variables and announcements of future 
shifts, and both changes in revenues and spending. All such elements are
 correlated to one another, so that it would be incorrect to make 
inference about "fiscal multipliers" assuming they are orthogonal to one
 another. The paper shows how multipliers can be estimated within a 
plan. As an application, the paper will also provide results on:
a. (For a set of 14 OECD countries over a 30-year period) on the 
disaggregated effects of shifts in fiscal variables, distinguishing 
between direct and indirect taxation and between transfers and 
government consumption and investment;

 increasing number of births are scheduled early for non-medical reasons
 in many countries in the belief that 37 weeks in the womb are enough. 
We provide new, credible causal evidence on the infant health 
consequences of scheduling birth early for non-medical reasons. We take 
advantage of quasi-experimental variation driven by an exogenous policy 
change in Spain. In May 2010, it was announced that an existing, 
generous universal child benefit would stop being paid for babies born 
in January 2011, thus providing pregnant women with a January due date 
with an economic incentive to schedule births earlier. After estimating 
that about 2,000 births, about 6% of all January births, were shifted 
back to December in order to qualify for the benefit, we evaluate the 
health effects of early delivery for the affected babies using 
high-quality administrative data from birth certificates and hospital 
records for children born in Spain from 2000 to 2012. Our identification
 strategy relies on comparing the health outcomes of all babies born 
close to the New Year of 2010-11, to those born on the same dates in the
 surrounding years, using October and November as “control months." We 
find that affected babies (those delivered early due to the benefit 
cancellation) were born more than 250 grams (8 percent) smaller on 
average as a result, and suffered a 20 percentage-point increase in 
hospitalizations due to respiratory disease during the second and third 
months of life.  We are the first to provide credible causal evidence on
 the effect of scheduling birth for non-medical reasons on health 
outcomes beyond birth. Our results also shed some light onto the 
mechanisms behind the strong associations between weight at birth and a 
range of short and long-term outcomes documented in literature, linking 
them to a lower maturation of these babies at birth.</div>

self-ignorance matters: nearly three of five subjects (58 percent) chose

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11023_abstract">A
 shadow banking system featuring collateral constraints is studied to 
investigate the joint determination of haircut and interest rate, as 
well as its implications for asset pricing. The banks with limited 
commitment serve the households’ need for consumption smoothing by 
taking deposits with a risky asset used as collateral and pursue the 
maximal leverage returns. In a collateral equilibrium as in Geanakoplos 
(1997, 2003), agents' marginal rates of substitution are equalized only 
in non-default states, only the deposit contract with the highest 
liquidity value per unit of collateral is traded, and the risky asset 
price is boosted such that banks earn zero profit. Relative to the 
traditional banking with full commitment, banks are better off if they 
are endowed with the collateral asset while households are strictly 
worse off. I also find (i) higher households’ risky asset endowment 
leads to a higher asset price because a stronger saving motive creates a
 scarcity of collateral, while higher banks' collateral endowment has 
the opposite effects; (ii) collateral use exhibits a diminishing return 
to scale in the amount of borrowing supported; (iii) for the quality of 
collateral, the higher asset price results from an upside improvement 
simply leads to a higher haircut with the interest rate unchanged since 
lenders do not care about upside risk; on the contrary, for lenders with
 a low risk aversion, a downside improvement of quality increases asset 
price and lowers interest rate but the tendency to reduce the haircut is
 alleviated by a reduced saving motive of households, and everything 
goes the opposite for a high risk aversion.</div>

 stringent financial regulation always secure financial stability? No, 
not when shadow banking plays a role. This paper incorporates shadow 
banking modeled as off-balance-sheet financing in a standard 
continuous-time macro-finance model. In this model, regular banks pursue
 regulatory arbitrage by extending their businesses outside the 
regulatory perimeter via shadow banking. The absence of regulatory 
authorities in the shadow banking sector creates an enforcement problem.
 We show that the enforcement problem gives rise to an endogenous 
constraint on leverage for shadow banking. Shadow banking adds to 
financial instability because tightening market discipline in economic 
downturns forces shadow banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices to 
regular banks. Overall, financial instability as a function of financial
 regulation is U-shaped rather than monotonically decreasing as 
conventional wisdom predicts. This paper proposes a framework that can 
comprehensively evaluate the impact of different regulatory regimes on 
both the regulated and unregulated banking sectors.</div>

 develop a new model of the mortgage market where both borrowers and 
lenders can default. Risk tolerant savers (risk takers) act as 
intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. 
The government plays a crucial role by providing both mortgage 
guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage 
guarantees lead to risky mortgage origination and excessive financial 
sector leverage. Mortgage crises frequently turn into financial crises 
and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries' 
balance sheets. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee crowds in
 the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to less and 
safer mortgage lending, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and 
risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector, 
consumption smoothing improves and all agents in the economy are 
strictly better off. The welfare gains are particularly large for the 
risk takers so that the private market solution increases wealth 
inequality.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11716_abstract">In
 this paper, I measure the interbank counterparty risk embedded in bank 
credit default swap (CDS) contracts. When a bank writes a CDS contract 
on the default of another bank, the buyer of that contract is faced with
 the risk of joint default by both banks. Using a unique feature of CDS 
data, I present a new approach for valuing CDS spreads that enables 
identification of the joint and conditional default probabilities, 
allowing for time variant recovery rates. I use the term structure of 
CDS spreads and option implied default probabilities to estimate 
time-variant joint default probabilities and time-variant recovery 
rates. In comparison to this approach, estimating interbank counterparty
 risk from CDS spreads assuming a fixed recovery rate underestimates 
joint default probability when the market is in distress. I apply the 
joint estimation method to measure interbank counterparty risk of CDS 
dealers from 2007 to 2010 and find that the fixed recovery rate model 
underestimates expected counterparty risk by approximately 21% when the 
market is in distress. In addition, I show that a bank’s vulnerability 
to systemic risk, defined as the average conditional default probability
 of a bank conditional on default of its counterparties, is correlated 
with existing measure of systemic risk.</div>

 theoretically and empirically demonstrate that  monopolistic or 
collusive banks will keep lending to a loss-making firm  at an interest 
rate lower than the prime rate if the firm is located in an influential 
position in an inter-firm supply network. An influential firm generates a
 positive externality, and its exit damages the sales in the supply 
network. To internalize this externality, the banks may forbear on debt 
collection and/or bail out such influential firms when the cost to 
support the loss-making influential company can be recouped by imposing 
high interest on less influential companies. The analytical model shows 
that such forbearance can improve welfare. Our empirical study, 
performed using a unique dataset containing information about inter-firm
 transactions, provides evidence for such network-motivated lending 
decisions. In particular, this effect is more clearly observed at less 
credit-worthy firms whose main bank is a regional bank. Notably, we 
observe that such banks are often dominant lenders in the local loan 
market, and most of their clientele do not have direct access to the 
stock and bond market.</div>

 24 July 2012, the sovereign yield spreads of Italian and Spanish 
sovereign bonds vis-à-vis the Bund reached 500-650 basis points. The 
same spreads had been about 200 basis points lower only few months 
earlier in March 2012. On 26 July 2012, Mario Draghi, President of the 
European Central Bank (ECB), in a speech at an investment conference in 
London said that a "convertibility risk" explained this phenomenon, 
preventing the smooth functioning of the ECB's monetary policy across 
national borders inside the euro area and acknowledging that financial 
markets were pricing the risk of break-up. Therefore, he pledged to do 
"whatever it takes" to protect the euro area from collapse.

Can we measure currency redenomination risk, that is the compensation 
demanded by market participants for the risk that a euro asset is being 
redenominated into a devalued legacy currency?

We propose a time-varying, country-specific market perception of 
intra-euro area redenomination risk measure, defined as the quanto CDS 
of a member country relative to the quanto CDS of a benchmark member 
country. Focusing on Italy, Spain and France and using Germany as 
benchmark, the proposed measure of currency redenomination risk reached a
 peak for both Italy and Spain just before the speech by President 
Draghi on 26 July 2012. Thereafter, it declined and since the end of 
2012 it has remained contained. We then show that the redenomination 
risk shocks, defined as the unexplained component of the market 
perception of redenomination risk orthogonal to exchange rate, global, 
regional and liquidity risks, significantly affect sovereign yield 
spreads, with Italy and Spain being the countries most adversely 
affected, followed by France. Finally, foreign redenomination risk 
shocks spillover and above local redenomination risk shocks, 
corroborating the fact that this risk is systemic.</div>

 rate guidance, which has been used with increasing regularity by 
monetary policymakers, relies on the manipulation of expectations of 
future short-term interest rates.  We identify shocks to these 
expectations at short and long horizons since the early 1980s and 
examine their effects on contemporaneous macroeconomic outcomes.  Our 
identification uses sign restrictions on survey forecasts incorporated 
in a structural VAR model to isolate expected deviations from the 
monetary-policy rule.  We find that expectations of future policy easing
 that materialize over the subsequent four quarters---similar to those 
generated by credible forward guidance---have immediate and persistent 
stimulative effects on output, inflation, and employment.  The effects 
are larger than those produced by an identical shift in the policy path 
that is not anticipated.  Our results are broadly consistent with the 
mechanism underlying forward guidance in New Keynesian models, but they 
suggest that those models overstate the persistence of the inflation 
response.  Further, we find that changes in short-rate expectations 
farther in the future have weaker macroeconomic effects, the opposite of
 what most New Keynesian models predict.

 construct carry trade portfolios using daily data (2004-14) from the US
 and two dozen foreign countries, with foreign countries sorted by 
interest differentials.  Every 3 months, we go long the m-horizon 
foreign bonds and short the m-horizon US bond.  Portfolios are held for 3
 months and then rebalanced.  We track their daily performance.   Of 
particular interest are the portfolio returns on days of US and foreign 
monetary policy announcements.  We conjecture that for small m, this 
would be essentially the exchange rate returns, as jumps in interest 
differentials won’t do much to bond prices.  For large m, it would be a 
mix of exchange rate returns and change in interest differentials.  
Preliminary results for m=3 months suggest that excess returns are large
 and larger for the high interest rate portfolios, in line with extant 
literature, and that they are positively and significantly related to US
 monetary policy surprises.  We then estimate a structural VAR in US and
 foreign interest rates and exchange rates, in order to assess the 
effects of monetary policy shocks.  These shocks are identified through 
the method of external instruments. Having obtained the dynamic effects 
on future interest rates and exchange rates, we compute the effects on 
financial market risk premia. We find that US monetary policy easing 
shocks significantly lower domestic and foreign bond risk premia, and 
lead to dollar depreciation. They have a significant effect on the yen 
foreign exchange risk premium, but not on other foreign exchange risk 
premia. UK and Japanese monetary policy easings also significantly lower
 domestic term premia and lead to domestic currency depreciation. The 
ECB monetary policy surprise lowers domestic term premia, but has no 
significant effect on the US term premia or on the foreign exchange risk
 premium.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20568_abstract">We
 propose a new model to explain the failure of UIP and the profitability
 of the carry trade and to link these two phenomena to the 
Balassa-Samuelson effect and the Backus-Smith puzzle. The key features 
of our model are market incompleteness and partial risk sharing through 
tradable goods. In the model, carry trade profits are due to two 
independent channels. First, a purely nominal channel, which works even 
in complete markets, makes the carry trade risky due to (endogenously) 
counter-cyclical inflation. Second, a real channel, which, due to 
imperfect risk sharing, makes the carry trade risky exactly when risk 
sharing is needed most. The model is consistent with several empirical 
facts. In particular: (i) real and nominal currency appreciations are 
positively related to domestic output and consumption growth, (ii) carry
 trade profits are positively related to output and consumption growth, 
but negatively to inflation in the target (high interest rate) country, 
(iii) ex-ante, target countries are smaller and have higher expected 
inflation volatility, but there do not appear to be systematic 
differences between high and low interest rate countries in loadings on 
world output growth, in expected output growth, or in output volatility.
 Leading existing models give opposite predictions.</div>

 interest rate currencies yield high currency excess returns on

 are men more risk tolerant than women, and why do they invest more than

 I manipulate identity in a controlled environment by priming its 
salience to subjects. I interpret the priming of male identity as making
 salient the most representative types associated with men, which 
increases the subjective beliefs of experiencing good outcomes in risky 
environments. Men whose identity is primed take on more risk, and invest
 more often and more money than controls. Inducing overconfidence 
similarly makes men invest more. As for the channels, I verify that the 
primes increase subjects' beliefs of experiencing good outcomes. 
Moreover, the effects are stronger for older cohorts of subjects,

 Portfolio Management Program (PMP) in Vienna Austria has been in 
existence for more than ten years. This paper analyzes the ten year 
performance (2004-2014) of the three competing funds with the objective 
of using this controlled setting to test two behavioral theories of 
funds management. We test both the tournament effect and the disposition
 effect, as well as looking at a selection of demographic variables.  
Consistent with tournament theory, the funds behave as predicted with 
trailing funds shifting into idiosyncratic risks that leading funds 
cannot mimic.  The paper also documents a definitive reverse disposition
 effect, whereby losing assets are more likely to be sold than winning 
assets. We identify a group size effect where larger managerial teams 
are more cautious and have lower risk adjusted returns. These results 
show that managerial behavior in the partly controlled setting of 
academic guidance can vary greatly from what has been found with retail

 term structure of equity returns is downward sloping. High duration 
stocks, whose cashflows are concentrated in the future, earn lower 
returns than low duration stocks. I provide evidence consistent with 
temporary overpricing of short-sale constrained, high duration stocks. 
Using institutional ownership as a proxy for short-sale constraints, I 
find that low returns of high duration stocks are contained within 
short-sale constrained portfolios: the spread in Fama &amp; French 
alphas between low and high duration portfolios is 1.52% per month for 
the most constrained stocks. This difference decreases monotonically 
with less binding short-sale constraints to an insignificant 0.29% per 
month for the least short-sale constrained stocks. These effects are 
stronger after periods of high investor sentiment, lending support to 
sentiment-based overpricing when short-sale constraints keep

 study the channels through which financial hedging affects firm value. 
To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we use a natural experiment in which 
Canadian light oil producers experience a relative loss in their ability
 to hedge compared to U.S. oil producers. The shock is caused by the 
unexpected breakdown in the correlation of Canadian light oil prices 
with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark prices used in hedging 
contracts. Using a difference-in-differences framework we compare 
Canadian (treatment) versus U.S. (control) light oil producers. After 
the hedging shock, we find that treatment firms reduce investment, sell 
assets, and have lower valuations. Our findings are driven by firms with
 ex ante high leverage. Overall, our results provide evidence that 
hedging affects firm value by alleviating financial distress costs and 
underinvestment.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20403_abstract">This paper shows that real decisions depend not only on the total amount of information in
prices, but the source of this information – a manager learns from prices when they contain
information not possessed by him. We use the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws
across 26 countries as a shock to the source of information that leaves total information
unchanged, since enforcement reduces (increases) managers’ (outsiders’) contribution to the
stock price. Enforcement increases investment-Q sensitivity, but does not increase the
sensitivity of investment to non-price measures of investment opportunities. This increase is
stronger in emerging markets, where total price informativeness is unaffected by enforcement
(Fernandes and Ferreira (2009)), and in industries with high concentration and high sales
volatility, where the scope for managerial learning is greater (Allen (1993)). These findings
suggest that extant measures of price efficiency should be rethought when evaluating real
efficiency.</div>

 short ratio -- shares shorted to shares outstanding -- is an oft-used 
measure of arbitrageurs' opinion about a stock's over-valuation. We show
 that days-to-cover (DTC), which divides a stock's short ratio by its 
average daily share turnover, is actually the theoretically correct 
measure because trading costs vary across stocks. Since trading costs 
are inversely related to share turnover, DTC is then approximately the 
marginal cost of the shorts. At the arbitrageurs' optimum it equals the 
marginal benefit of the shorts, which is their opinion about 
over-valuation. Consistent with our model, DTC is a stronger predictor 
of poor stock returns than short ratio. It is distinct from the stock 
lending fee effect but has comparable forecasting power. An 
equal-weighted long-short strategy based on DTC generates a significant 
return of 1.2% per month.</div>

 study the dynamic decision making of a financial institution in the 
presence of a novel implementation friction that gives rise to 
operational risk. We distinguish between internal and external 
operational risks depending on whether the institution has control over 
them. Internal operational risk naturally arises in the context of model
 risk, as the institution exposes itself to operational errors whenever 
it updates and improves its investment model. In this case, it is no 
longer optimal to implement the best model available, thus leaving scope
 for endogenous deviation from it, and hence model sophistication. We 
show that the optimal exposure to operational risk may well become 
decreasing in the level of internal operational risk, which in turn 
makes the exposure to market risk less volatile. We uncover that 
financial constraints interact with operational risk, whether internal 
or external, and prompt the institution to always adopt a more 
sophisticated model. While such constraints are always detrimental when 
operational risk is internal, they may be beneficial, despite inducing 
an excessive level of sophistication, when it is external.</div>

 is often funded with fees paid by regulated firms, potentially creating
 incentive problems. We use this feature to study the incentives of 
regulators and their ability to affect firm behavior. Theoretically, we 
show that firms that pay higher fees may face more lenient regulation, 
when leniency increases regulatory budgets in the short term. Our 
identification approach uses multiple kinks in fee schedules of federal 
bank regulators as a source of exogenous variation. Using a novel 
dataset on fees and regulatory actions, we find that firms that pay 
higher fees face more lenient regulation, which leads to a buildup of 
risk. Higher fee-paying banks are allowed higher leverage and asset 
risk, and in the longer term have more loan defaults and a higher 
likelihood of regulatory actions, which tend to follow banking crises.</div>

 take advantage of the pre-emption of national banks from state 
anti-predatory lending laws as a quasi-experiment to study the effect of
 deregulation and its interaction with competition on the supply of 
complex mortgages (interest only, negative amortization, and teaser 
mortgages). We first show that following the pre-emption ruling, 
national banks significantly increased their origination of loans with 
prepayment penalties and negative amortization features, relative to 
non-OCC regulated lenders, and lenders in states without anti-predatory 
lending laws. This increase in the supply of complex mortgages is 
significantly more pronounced for banks that poorly performed in the 
previous quarters. Further, we highlight a competition channel: first, a
 higher degree of competition induce OCC lenders to originate more 
riskier loans; second, in counties where OCC regulated lenders had 
larger market share prior to the pre-emption, even non-OCC lenders 
responded by increasing the presence of predatory terms to the extent 
permitted by the state anti-predatory lending laws. Overall, our 
evidence is suggestive that the deregulation of credit markets ignited a
 "race to the bottom" among distressed financial institutions, working 
through the competition between lenders.</div>

supervisors to the extent that their objective functions differ. Information
collection will be inferior\ to what would happen in a model with fully

collects information. The reason is that local agents will, in some states of

 study the interaction between optimal contracts and equilibrium pricing

supply curves which, in turn, can lead to multiple equilibria. Because 
all players maximize expected utility and contracts are optimal, welfare
 is well-defined. We therefore analyze the private and social costs and 
benefits of margins. Privately optimal margins, and the associated 
fire-sales arising in equilibrium, are larger than their second-best

 address the issue of the welfare costs of informed trade, we construct a
 new Glosten-Milgrom type model with elastic uninformed trade.  The 
bid-ask spread causes a welfare loss because uninformed agents choose 
not to trade when their idiosyncratic valuation lies within the spread. 
 We show that if private information is sufficiently long lived (long 
time until it is revealed), the average spread and total welfare loss 
are mainly decreasing in the amount of informed trade.  This result 
contrasts with familiar comparative statics and arises due to a 
tradeoff: more informed trade results in wider spreads and larger 
welfare costs initially, but because information is reflected in prices 
faster, spreads and welfare costs are lower later.  For short-lived 
information, the tradeoff does not materialize and thus spreads and 
welfare losses are mainly increasing in informed trade.  Our findings

should consider the horizon of private information.</div>

 CDX is an index of credit default swaps on major U.S. corporations. In 
the 2005– 2008 period, contracts on the CDX as a whole and on tranches 
of the CDX were actively traded. Senior tranches are essentially deep 
out-of-the-money options because they do not incur any losses until a 
large number of investment-grade firms default. Because of the liquidity
 of these contracts, their spreads provide a unique window into how the 
market assesses the risk of a rare disaster. We propose a model to 
jointly explain the spreads on each CDX tranche, as well as prices on 
put options and the aggregate market. Our results demonstrate the

 uncover significant effects of jump risk on conditional equity premium.
 Realized
volatility  due to negative or “bad”  (positive or “good”) jumps in 
stock market prices predicts a rising (falling) near-term equity 
premium. The forecasting power of signed jump risk measures remains 
statistically significant even when we control for variance risk premium
 that Drechsler and Yaron (2011) attribute  to jump risk.   Our novel 
empirical findings are broadly consistent with an extended Drechsler and
 Yaron model that also allows stochastic volatility  of volatility to 
affect variance risk premium and
conditional equity premium as in Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009).

 analyze land values from market transactions across the United States. 
Across space, land values are distributed widely and almost 
log-normally. The strongest predictor of value per acre is lot size, 
followed by location, and then time. Urban and agricultural land markets
 appear unified after accounting for fixed conversion costs. The 
relationship between peak metropolitan land values and populations, 
agricultural values, and arcs of urban expansion is roughly consistent 
with monocentric-city predictions and within-metro estimates of the rent
 gradient. Our estimates suggest land receives 7 percent of income and 
the cost elasticity of urban population is 3 percent of income.</div>

other measures of local wellbeing. Further, we estimate the entire

low income assistance, despite economists’ prescriptions that such behavior is extremely inefficient.
We utilize explanations from urban economics that suggest cities have significant land rents. If city
governments can access some of these rents, then local taxation may not be inefficient. Using a panel
sample of the 53 largest cities in the U.S. over 18 years, we estimate using instrumental variable (IV)
models, the determinants of large city expenditures, revenues and taxes as a function of suburban
choices. Analogously, we do a similar estimation for the suburban fiscal variables as being related to
the large city choices. We find that large cities generally lower the welfare of their citizens in
response to innovations in the suburbs. We interpret this evidence as being suggestive of rent
extraction. We find, however, that these rents are used to support the low income assistance budgets.</div>

 create a dataset from administrative records that combines subsidized 
housing receipt with earnings information of residents to estimate how 
public housing project demolitions affect long-term earnings outcomes of
 children. Households forced to move out of public housing projects by 
demolitions may migrate to lower poverty neighborhoods—potentially 
giving children access to better peers and better schools—but they face 
substantial adjustment costs as household members are forced to search 
for new housing and adapt to new living arrangements. We compare movers 
and stayers within a sample of public housing projects that were 
partially demolished between 1998 and 2005 to identify the long-term net
 effect of these demolitions. We find that while movers and stayers have
 similar pre-demolition characteristics, children from households that 
moved due to a demolition have lower labor market earnings as adults. 
This negative effect is larger for girls and, on average, amounts to 
5-10 percent of typical annual earnings.</div>

 this paper, we look at the effect of the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) 
and the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) programs on 
new business activity. Since previous research has found that 
entrepreneurial activity is positively associated with job growth in the
 United States, one way governments can attract entrepreneurs is to 
provide incentives to new businesses that locate in economically 
distressed communities. However, there is a debate over how to allocate 
these funds: give small amounts of funding to numerous projects or give 
larger amounts of funding to a few projects. Using individual 
establishment data from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) 
database for California, and data on which census tracts received 
funding through the CDFI and NMTC programs, we consider the impact of 
these two programs on attracting new businesses. We find that in the 
tracts that are close to the programs’ plausibly exogenous eligibility 
thresholds, higher levels of funding through the NMTC program are 
associated with increases in the number of new establishments that 
locate in the area, while the number of projects funded has no effect. 
We do not find evidence of a significant effect of the CDFI program on 
where new businesses locate. The amounts of funding through the CDFI 
program are relatively small, though many projects were funded through 
this program. Thus, our findings suggest that it is the amount of 
funding allocated to these areas that has the strongest effect on 
development, more so than the number of projects funded.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13806_abstract">Using
 tax abatements, financial incentives, and public investments to attract
 (or retain) firms is the primary economic development tool for many 
local governments. Often local job creation policies focus on increasing
 capital through grants, low interest financing, and other economic 
development incentives. Theory predicts that capital subsidies induce 
firm behaviors that limit their job creation effects. This paper employs
 the Incentives Environment Index, constructed from state constitutional
 provisions that limit and structure the ability of state and local 
governmental entities to aid private enterprises, and five year county 
panels to test theoretical predictions on county capital expenditure and
 input mixes as well as industry establishment shares. The results 
indicate increasing capital subsidy tools is associated with 
capital-labor substitution, decreased employment density, and changes in
 local industry mix. Results are robust to alternative empirical 
specifications and measures of capital subsidy availability.</div>

 the 2007-2009 housing crisis, concentrations of foreclosed and vacant 
properties created severe blight in many cities and neighborhoods. The 
federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was established to help
 mitigate distress in hard-hit areas by funding the rehabilitation or 
demolition of troubled properties. This paper analyzes housing market 
changes in areas that received investments during the second round of 
NSP funding, focusing on seven large urban counties. Grantees used NSP 
to invest in census tracts with high rates of distressed and vacancy 
properties, and tracts that had previously received other housing 
subsidies. The median NSP tract received quite sparse investment, 
relative to the overall housing stock and the initial levels of 
distress. Analysis of housing market outcomes indicates the recovery has
 been uneven across counties and neighborhoods. In a few counties, there
 is some evidence that NSP2 activity is correlated with improved housing
 outcomes.</div>

 use a correspondence study of the low-wage labor market in Washington, 
DC to test whether employers discriminate against applicants who live 
further from the job location. I find that fictional résumés randomly 
assigned to have addresses far from the job location receive 14% fewer 
callbacks than nearby addresses that are on average 2.6 miles closer. 
This effect is economically large; the measured distance penalty in 
callback rates equals 40% of the penalty experienced by applicants with 
stereotypically black names. On the other hand, evidence that employers 
respond to neighborhood affluence is mixed. The results have two main 
implications. First, previously documented discrimination against 
applicants from less affluent neighborhoods can mostly be accounted for 
by the fact that poor neighborhoods tend to be far from jobs. Second, 
the results provide evidence for one mechanism by which housing market 
outcomes may affect urban poverty and labor markets. Employer 
discrimination by commute distance will reduce economic prospects of 
everyone in a neighborhood, potentially contributing to concentrated 
poverty in locations far from jobs.</div>

 develop a spatial equilibrium job search model to study how spatial 
mismatch emerges as the outcome of matching between firms and workers. 
The model offers a unique opportunity to decompose unemployment and wage
 differentials across locations between search frictions, commuting 
cost, and individual observed heterogeneity. The trade-off between 
profit per unit of labor (intensive margin) and size (extensive margin) 
in the firms location choice problem generates a selection process that 
drives the least productive firms into the spatially mismatched 
location, and gives employers a monopsony power over workers. We show 
that the intensity of the distortion is completely captured by the 
inverse semi-elasticity of workforce size with respect to wages. Our 
structural estimates based on the French Labor Survey show that both 
spatial frictions and commuting cost are important. We use the model to 
quantify the welfare loss due to spatial mismatch and propose a formal

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13843_abstract">Policy
 makers agree that vacant houses are undesirable. Moreover the existence
 of empty houses is used as an argument for allocating less land for new
 construction. So higher vacancy rates tend to trigger tighter 
restrictions on the supply of land. Such tighter restrictions lead to 
higher prices and, because of the incentives this creates for occupying 
housing, to lower housing vacancies (‘opportunity cost effect’). There 
is, however, a second effect ignored by urban planners: more restrictive
 planning policy impedes the matching process in housing markets so 
leading to higher vacancies (‘mismatch effect’). Which of these two 
forces dominates is an empirical question. This question is our focus 
here. Addressing potential reverse causation and other endogeneity 
concerns, we use a unique panel data set on land use regulation for 350 
Local Authorities in England from 1981 to 2011. Our results show that 
tighter local planning constraints increase local housing vacancy rates,
 suggesting that the mismatch effect dominates. A one standard deviation
 increase in local regulatory restrictiveness causes the average local 
vacancy rate to increase by about 0.9 percentage points (23 percent). 
The results are economically meaningful and show that pointing to the 
existence of vacant houses as a reason for being more restrictive in 
allocating land for housing is counterproductive.</div>

 are the payoffs from membership in the European Union (EU)? How do 
these change across countries and over time? This paper addresses these 
questions by constructing econometric counterfactuals for 17 countries 
that joined the EU over four decades (in 1973, 1980s, 1995 and 2004 
enlargements). The estimated growth and productivity effects from EU 
membership are large, significant and almost unanimously positive (they 
are negative only for Greece). Although they vary substantially both

 countries of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) initiated 
wide-ranging labor market reforms in the last decade. This process is 
ongoing as countries that are faced with serious labor market imbalances
 perceive reforms as the fastest way to restore competitiveness within a
 currency union. This fosters fears among observers about a 
beggar-thy-neighbor policy that leaves non-reforming countries with a 
loss in competitiveness and an increase in foreign debt. Using a 
two-country, two-sector search and matching DSGE model, we analyze the 
impact of labor market reforms on the transmission of macroeconomic 
shocks in both, non-reforming and reforming countries. By analyzing the 
impact of reforms on foreign debt, we contribute to the debate on 
whether labor market reforms increase or reduce current account 
imbalances.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13880_abstract">This
 paper examines shareholder voice at company general meetings in Europe.
 Using management and shareholder proposals submitted in 17 countries, 
we investigate whether dissent against management is affected by 
meeting, proposal and firm characteristics, as well as the various 
regulatory provisions that have been argued to affect meeting access and
 participation. We find that while shareholder engagement at European 
meetings remains limited, it tends to be well-placed. Shareholders are 
most likely to act on anti-takeover devices and executive compensation, 
and submit their own proposals against large and poorly performing 
firms. Critically, we show that national regulation plays a major role 
in galvanizing shareholders, lending strong support to the European 
Commission’s Shareholder Rights Directive, and the broader 
pro-shareholder regulatory trend that has emerged post-crisis worldwide.
 At the same time, we find that shareholders use their voice more at the
 firm level when concerned about the institutional environment at the 
country level, and the quality of minority investor protection in 
particular. We conclude that shareholder engagement at company general 
meetings is a part of good governance, and regulators should go beyond 
minimum standards pro-actively to support shareholder rights.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13881_abstract">Europe
 has changed dramatically in the last two decades as a result of large 
policy initiatives such as the introduction of the Euro, EU expansion 
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. These changes create a natural 
environment for experiments in the effects of policy and the functioning
 of markets. We consider the effect of these changes on the European 
market for corporate control. This is not only a large market, but it is
 sensitive to policy and likely to react strongly to change. We test 
this proposition using a sample of 263,570 mergers and acquisitions, 
announced and completed in the period 1985-2014. Some of our findings 
are in line with our expectations. E.g., we find that:  the Fall of the 
Wall dramatically increased the number of deals done in the region: 
there were 4,194 more deals done after 1991 than had been predicted 
before the fall of the wall. Most of these acquisitions were by Western 
European acquirers looking for Eastern targets. We find that joining the
 Eurozone increases the number of deals to and from the joining country,
 and that the expansion of the Eurozone has lead Eurozone acquirers to 
prefer Eurozone targets over non-Eurozone targets. The Eurozone has led 
to more integration. Some of our other findings are unexpected.  Joining
 the EU, and the Single market negatively impacts the number of 
cross-border acquisitions both into, and out of, the joining country. We
 suggest that there may be greater arbitrage opportunities those outside
 of the EU / Single market, than for those inside the EU / Single 
Market.</div>

 article deals with the relationship between development, creativity, 
and culture. It is based upon the works of Celso Furtado, Brazilian 
economist, member of ECLAC’s first generation of scholars along with 
Raul Prebisch, and notable intellectual of sub-development and 
development in Brazil and Latin America. For the author, economic 
development is an endogenous social process, which leads to human 
ingenuity and creativity. However, Furtado argues that creativity does 
not occur haphazardly. It is conditioned by cultural structures which 
can be manifested in two forms: material (means) or immaterial (ends). 
The former orients creativity to serve material accumulation and 
consumption; the latter towards individuals’ existential way of life. 
Furtado’s central claim is that in the “industrial civilization”, values
 such as rationality and efficiency end up submitting human creativity 
to the production process.&lt;br /&gt;

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13962_abstract">We analyze a central question in environmental economics: How does imposing regulation in some
regions but not others affect the location of economic activity? And what does any movement of
economic activity imply for the welfare consequences of spatially differentiated regulation? We
investigate these questions in an important and understudied setting, passenger transportation. We analyze
how “smog check” inspection and maintenance programs affect both the trade of dirty vehicles from
regulated to unregulated counties and scrap decisions.

We use a natural experiment that gives rise to a fuzzy regression discontinuity design which exploits
features of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. We use this discontinuity to estimate the effect of
failing a smog check on trade, scrap, and emissions damages.

We have collected a dataset containing hundreds of millions of vehicle emissions inspections results for
the majority of the 30 U.S. states that have available test records. We combine these records with
extensive data on used vehicle registrations to track where a vehicle is registered at different points in
time. Such intranational trade data are a powerful and new tool to understand the consequences of
incomplete regulation. The data will allow us to assess whether or not emissions leakage is an
economically meaningful concern in vehicle markets, and if the marginal costs of pollution differ between
locations where economic activity began and the locations where environmental regulation caused the
activity to move.

This question is relevant for research and for policy—for example, whether only city centers or also
outlying suburbs should be regulated. This analysis is also relevant to fiscal federalism questions about
the optimal level of jurisdiction for policy.</div>

 automobile emissions are a major source of urban air pollution. Many 
U.S. states control emissions through mandated vehicle inspections and 
repairs. But there is little empirical evidence directly linking 
mandated inspections, maintenance, and local air pollution levels. Using
 individual-level data from 1998--2012 from California's inspection 
program, we estimate the contemporaneous effect of inspections on local 
air quality by exploiting day-to-day, within-county variation in the 
number of vehicles nominally repaired and recertified after failing an 
initial inspection. Additional re-inspections of pre-1985 model year 
vehicles reduce local carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate 
matter levels, while re-inspections of newer vehicles with more modern 
engine technology have no economically significant effect on air 
pollution. This suggests emissions inspections become less effective at 
reducing local air pollution as more high-polluting vehicles from the 
1970s and 1980s leave the road. We also estimate the importance of 
station quality, using a metric devised for California's new STAR 
certification program. We show re-inspections of older vehicles 
conducted by low quality inspection stations do not change air 
pollution, while inspections at high quality stations have a moderate 
effect on pollution concentrations. We find little effect on ambient 
ozone levels, regardless of station quality or vehicle age.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13964_abstract">Understanding
 the dynamics of coal-fired electricity is crucial for the design of 
policies that reduce its social costs (Chay and Greenstone, 2003, 2005; 
Barreca, Clay and Tarr, 2014). This paper examines the role of path 
dependence - the ongoing effects of obsolete past determinants - on the 
development of coal-fired electricity capacity in the U.S. midwest over 
the 20th century. I exploit spatial and temporal variation in 
county-level coal prices driven by the opening of deep coal mines 
following the introduction of mechanized mining. For a given county, I 
find that distance to a shallow coal mine that became obsolete after 
mechanization has an increasing effect on relative coal-fired capacity 
up to six decades after initial
obsolescence. The sign and duration of this effect cannot be explained 
alone by the durability and fixed costs associated with previously built
 coal-fired capacity. By the 1990s, path dependence explains 60% of 
total coal-fired capacity over sample counties. Analysis of electricity 
generating efficiency suggests path dependence may be occurring through 
coal-specific technological change (Schumpeter, 1942; Schmookler, 1966; 
David, 1985; Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Arthur, 1994). I expand on 
Acemoglu et al. (2012a)'s model of directed technical change to link my 
reduced-form estimates with a formal definition of technology-driven 
path dependence and a structural parameter which dictates policy design.
 The implied parameter
value suggests that a future permanent transition away from coal could 
be induced by a temporary policy intervention towards improving non-coal
 electricity productivity. I discuss implications for the current U.S. 
transition towards natural gas-fired electricity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13965_abstract">In the past decade, innovations  in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling
have fueled a boom in the production of natural gas from geological formations that
were previously unprofitable. Impacts on U.S. natural gas markets, generating important benefits 
to consumers and producers alike.  This transformation also has great potential to curtail the use 
of coal in power generation, and thereby lower greenhouse gas emissions.  But the rapid deployment 
of fracking has been accompanied by concerns about negative externalities, including impacts to air 
and water associated with the chemicals  used as injectants during the fracking process, or in the 
disposal of waste water; these concerns underscore the recently released federal rules governing 
fracking. One important element of these new rules is the stipulation that firms report the injec- 
tants used in the frack job. To shed light on the importance of such a disclosure rule, we combine 
data from wells drilled in two significant gas fields (the Pinedale Anticline and the Jonah Field, 
in Wyoming) with disclosure data concerning chemicals and materials injected into fracked wells 
from FracFocus. We discuss information on the role played by these injectants, their toxicity, and 
issues linked to “produced water,” which flows back from the well after the deposit is fracked. 
Importantly, there is a correlation between the number of toxic ingredients  used in a frack job 
and the number of ingredients whose identity is withheld because of alleged “trade secrets.” We 
also discuss the relation between toxicity  of injectants, tendency to use the trade secrets 
shield, and identity of service company who undertook the frack job, which has implications for the 
impact on social net benefits of the recently reported merger between Baker
Hughes and Halliburton – two of these service companies.</div>

 forms of substitutability are essential for establishing the existence

matching, auctions, and exchange economies with indivisible goods.  We 
extend earlier models' canonical definitions of substitutability to a

 seller in others, and show that all these definitions are equivalent. 
We introduce a new class of substitutable preferences called 
"intermediary with production capacity."  We then prove that 
substitutability is preserved under economically important 
transformations such as trade endowments, mergers, and limited 
liability.  We also show that substitutability corresponds to 
submodularity of the indirect utility function, the single improvement 
property, and a no complementarities condition.  Finally, we show that 
substitutability implies the monotonicity conditions known as the Laws

 real matching markets are subject to distributional constraints. To 
guide market designers faced with constraints, we propose new stability 
concepts. A matching is strongly stable if satisfying blocking pairs 
inevitably violates a constraint. We show that a strongly stable 
matching may not exist, and that existence is guaranteed if and only if 
all distributional constraints are trivial. To overcome this difficulty,
  we propose a more permissive concept, weak stability. We  demonstrate a
 weakly stable matching always exists,  implies efficiency, and  is 
characterized by standard normative axioms. These results are obtained 
in a more general environment than in existing studies, accommodating a

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21847_abstract">By
 reducing the negative correlation between local prices and productivity
 shocks, trade liberalization changes the volatility of returns. In the 
context of agriculture in developing countries—where production is 
risky, producers are risk averse, and insurance markets are 
incomplete—this change in volatility may have large welfare effects. In 
this paper, we empirically, analytically, and quantitatively explore the
 second moment effects of trade. Using forty years of agricultural 
micro-data from India, we show empirically that trade increased farmer's
 revenue volatility, causing farmers to shift production toward crops 
with higher mean and lower variance yields. We then incorporate 
producers’ optimal allocation of resources across risky production 
technologies into a general equilibrium trade model to show analytically
 two counter-intuitive results: (1) risk aversion can amplify the gains 
from trade (and, insurance can reduce the gains); and (2) when trade is 
costly, offering farmers insurance can make them worse off. Finally, we 
structurally estimate the model—recovering farmers' unobserved 
risk-return preferences from the gradient of the mean-variance frontier 
at their observed crop choice—to quantify the second moment welfare 
effects of trade. We find that the welfare costs of volatility are about
 one tenth the size of the first moment gains from trade. 
Counterfactuals show that the gains from trade would have been 10 
percent smaller if farmers had had access to perfect insurance, and 
furthermore access to perfect insurance itself would make most farmers 
worse off.</div>

 are the consequences for economic welfare of a disintegration of 
regional markets?  We consider a particularly stark example of such 
regional disintegration - the partition of British India in 1947.  Prior
 to 1947 British India was a free trade zone, but after the partition of
 the subcontinent into Pakistan and India in 1947, previously rich 
trading ties were severed almost immediately.  For example, trade flows 
between the Indian region of Punjab and the neighboring Pakistani region
 of Punjab were extremely high (approximately 80 percent of these 
regions’ external trade) prior to partition, and then essentially zero 
thereafter.  Using data on inter-regional trade flows within British 
India before and after partition we estimate the extent to which regions
 (such as Indian Punjab) that lost important trade partners due to 
partition were able to substitute towards alternative trading partners 
(such as, in the case of Indian Punjab, the rest of India, or the world 
other than Pakistan).  We then use these estimates and the trade data to
 measure the impact of partition on the living standards of each region 
of British India.  Our results imply that the adjustment of trade flows 
to substitute regions was swift and significant, so the welfare 
consequences of trade disintegration due to partition were relatively

Furthermore, investors demand large risk premiums for inflation risks,

we show that the uncertainty of the average forecast can be expressed as
 the disagreement among the forecasters plus the volatility of the

 investigate the dynamic response of local US labor markets to increased
 job creation by new businesses and compare the effects to overall labor
 demand shocks. To account for both dynamic and spatial dependence we 
employ a panel VAR that allows for varying degrees of spatial 
dependence. Following recent advances in the VAR literature we identify 
structural shocks using predictors based on historical industry 
structure and national industry-specific labor demand and job creation 
as instruments. We find that shocks to job creation by startups explain 
more than three times as much of the local variation in population 
growth than shocks to overall labor demand and about one third of the 
variation in wage growth. Taking account of the spatial dependence 
amplifies the effect of shocks on entry and exit rates by about 8% for 
the average location and by as much as 25-30% for spatially 
well-connected cities. However, these spillovers are less than 2% for 
population and wage growth.

explore one important mechanism, this paper focuses on employment

 firms or through the expansion of existing firms. We find that new firm
 entry is responsible for the bulk of net employment creation in 
response to changing local economic conditions than growth by 
established firms. Moreover, their responsiveness is larger in areas

 provide empirical evidence for the Keynesian demand-driven propagation:
 first rounds of job losses lead to additional rounds of job losses. To 
do so, we exploit the exogenous variations in the concentration of 
tradable sectors across U.S. counties. We find that counties with higher
 pre-crisis concentration of tradable industries experience stronger job
 losses in the non-tradable sector during the crisis. This is arguably 
because laid-off tradable workers cut their consumption, which hurts 
local non-tradable firms. This result is not driven by exposure to the 
construction sector, policy induced business uncertainty, or credit 
supply problem. In addition, the result is stronger when we focus on the
 concentration of hardest hit manufacturing industries.</div>

Nash demand game or an unstructured bargaining game, with bargaining 
position varied via the disagreement outcome. We find that subjects are 
more responsive to changes in bargaining position when disagreement 
payoffs are earned through a real-effort task than when the task only 
determines entry to the bargaining stage (with disagreement payoffs 
randomly assigned), but more responsive in the latter case than when 
there is no task and subjects simply bargain with randomly assigned 
disagreement payoffs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13767_abstract">It
 is well known that one of the features of Public Choice, political 
realism, in Italy enjoys a time-honored tradition going back to 
Machiavelli, and perpetuated by Pareto and Pantaleoni in their political
 and sociological writings. The scientific spirit leading in their era 
to the foundation of various social disciplines fostered the application
 of economic analysis to the political sphere. In this context the 
initiator of the pure theory of public finance, Antonio de Viti de Marco
 (1858-1943), formulated an economic model of the state, consisting of 
two types of constitutional extremes: the absolute state, and the 
democratic state. In this work, we examine the reasons driving him to 
develop this model, inquiring into whether his premises are analogous to
 those of Public Choice (homo oeconomicus and politics as exchange). 
Moreover, we ask how this may be reconciled to Mosca and Pareto’s theory
 of the ruling class, which De Viti de Marco agreed with. Finally, we 
analyze the validity of this theoretical construction for the 
interpretation of  “transformism”, the system of flexible alliances for 
building government coalitions which between 1880 and 1922 dominated 
Italian parliamentary politics. What emerges provides reasons to reflect
 upon for further developments in Public Choice.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13768_abstract">No
 individual in the history of public economics has been subject to more 
contentious discussion than Knut Wicksell – and perhaps no concept 
subjected to more diverse interpretation than Wicksell’s unanimity rule.
 The story begins in 1896 with the publication of Wicksell’s public 
finance treatise, Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen, and starts to take 
shape in 1906 [1971] with the publication of Pareto’s Manual of 
Political Economy. Contemporaries who had much in common, Wicksell and 
Pareto were unable to come to a meeting of the minds on a number of 
fundamental theoretical issues. The crux of the matter hinges on the 
relationship between Wicksell’s unanimity rule and Pareto optimality. 
What makes the Wicksell-Pareto discussion particularly interesting is 
the degree to which their ‘feud’ has continued in modern public 
economics, represented in the split between the public choice tradition 
of James Buchanan and Richard Musgrave’s triparate approach of 
allocation, distribution, and stabilization. This article examines Knut 
Wicksell’s one-sided debate with Vilfredo Pareto on issues in welfare 
economics and considers the trajectory of their economic ideas that led 
to an eventual convergence between Wicksellian unanimity and Pareto 
optimality in public choice.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13769_abstract">Starting
 around 1880 and continuing into the 1930s, Italian theorists treated 
public finance as an explanatory and not a hortatory scheme of thought. 
It is here where public choice began. Gunter Schmölders recognized this 
clearly when he explained in a 1960 German translation of a 1903 book by
 Amilcare Puviani that “over the last century Italian public finance has
 had an essentially political science character.” It should be noted 
that the Italian scholars did not speak with one voice. For instance, 
Vilfredo Pareto differed sharply from his good friend Maffeo Pantaleoni.
 Where Pantaleoni extended economics to politics by conceptualizing a 
political price system as existing parasitically on a market price 
system, Pareto invoked a disjunction between logical (economic) and 
non-logical (political) action. This disjunction led Pareto to pursue 
schemes of thought that made contact with themes advanced by such 
sociologists as Roberto Michels and Gaetano Mosca, as well as with the 
fiscal sociology of Joseph Schumpeter and Rudolf Goldscheid. While 
public choice, with its economics of politics theme, can be traced to 
Italian public finance, the analytical domain of public choice is 
narrower than that earlier body of scholarship. This paper explores this
 narrowing of the field of vision and explains why many scholarly 
opportunities await efforts to bring forward this broader Italianate 
vision into contemporary political economy.</div>

 1960 the Thomas Jefferson Center applied for a grant from the Ford 
Foundation. The Foundation turned down their proposal because of the 
Center’s purportedly unified “point of view.”  This paper presents the 
correspondence and private discussions related to the incident. 
Following the submission of their proposal, Buchanan, Nutter and then 
UVA President Shannon met with representatives of the Foundation, Tom 
Carroll and Kermit Gordon.  Buchanan concluded that the “reaction of the
 Ford representatives must be considered to have been almost wholly 
negative.” The crux of the matter was the "single ‘point of view’," 
apparently an ideological perspective in line with Chicago-style 
economics.  Buchanan attempted to dispel this conclusion, arguing that 
the program was “sufficiently broad” to “encompass wide and divergent 
points of view.”  He was struck by Gordon’s statement that by contrast, 
“neither Yale nor Harvard” “reflect[ed] a point of view in their 
economics.” Coase was incensed by the allegation of ideological 
narrowness since, as he explained, he had close ties to the Fabian 
Society. Despite attempts to defend their proposal, the Ford officials 
turned down the application and the TJC never fully recovered.</div>

 paper quantitatively studies the behaviour of household deposit funding
 at major banks in the United Kingdom. We estimate a panel of Bayesian 
vector autoregressive models on a unique dataset compiled by the Bank of
 England, and identify deposit demand and supply shocks, both to 
individual banks and in aggregate, using micro-founded sign 
restrictions. Based on the impulse responses, we estimate how much banks
 are required to increase their deposit rates by, in order to cover a 
deposit gap opened up following each type of funding shock. Subject to 
our modelling assumptions, banks generally find it costly to bid-up for 
deposits to cover a funding gap in the short-run. We compute dynamic 
rate-elasticities, and find that the rate elasticity of deposits is 
typically of the order of 0.3 - but this varies across banks and the 
types of shock these are conditional on. We also show evidence that 
banks are more vulnerable to deposit supply shocks. Historical 
decompositions show that the shock dynamics uncovered by the model can 
be used to explain historical data.</div>

 article provides an empirical evidence to the claim that influence by 
financial institutions distorts the policy formation process. We use a 
unique detailed database with state
campaign contributions made by banks in the U.S. from 1998 to 2010 to 
understand how these contributions influence regulation of the banking 
industry. We consider the procedure of approval of bank mergers by the 
state banking regulatory authority. Banks that are acquiring other banks
 in the near future tend to contribute more to candidates that play a 
key role in the oversight of the state banking regulator. Our results 
show a clear link between merger efficiency and regulation since poorly 
performed banks that fail or are acquired tend to contribute much less 
than acquirer banks. Interestingly, marginal banks that may raise more 
concerns among regulators in the approval process are more likely to 
contribute. All these results suggest a link between merger effciency

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12145_abstract">Abstract:
 Decision support tools, menu restrictions, and default options are 
examples of choice architecture—the design of the market environment in 
which consumers make decisions. Policies that modify choice architecture
 can create winners and losers. Some people may benefit if the policy 
makes people better informed by reducing search costs, switching costs, 
and psychological biases. Other people may lose if the new architecture 
eliminates their preferred options, provides incomplete information, or 
exacerbates externalities generated by the equilibrium sorting process. 
We develop and validate a structural model for estimating heterogeneous 
welfare effects of prospective modifications to choice architecture and 
apply it to the insurance market for Medicare prescription drug plans 
(PDP). Our model distinguishes between active and passive choices made 
by people with and without full information about PDP attributes 
reflecting cost, risk reduction, and quality. We identify model 
parameters using a novel combination of nationally representative survey
 and administrative data on PDP enrollment decisions from 2006-2010. 
First we identify decisions that we suspect may not reveal people’s true
 preferences due to incomplete information. Then we estimate separate 
models of PDP enrollment decisions for people making informed and 
uninformed choices.  Finally, we combine the two models to predict 
welfare effects of three prospective policies designed to simplify the 
market: (1) providing personalized information, (2) establishing a low 
cost default option, and (3) reducing the number of PDPs. We find that 
the mean and median consumer would benefit from personalized information
 and the default options, whereas most would lose from the menu 
restrictions. The average gain in consumer welfare ranges from $10 to 
$153, which is equivalent to 1% to 11% of consumer expenditures.  These 
gains are often overshadowed by transfers from insurers to taxpayers in 
the form of lower premium subsidies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12146_abstract">The
 economic rationale for recent expansion in health plan choice presumes 
that individuals are able to sensibly choose from available options. We 
test this presumption by assessing the quality of over 50,000 health 
insurance decisions made by employees at a U.S. firm given the option to
 “build your own” plan from a menu of 48 plans of which a large share 
were financially dominated.  The menu offers a unique litmus test for 
evaluating choice quality in that no set of standard risk preferences or
 beliefs regarding future health can rationalize enrollment into 
dominated plans.  We find that a majority of employees chose dominated 
options, resulting in excess spending equivalent to an average of 42% of
 the annual plan premium. Employees fail to improve plan choice over 
time, and older workers, women, and low earners were disproportionately 
likely to make costly errors.  A series of follow-up hypothetical choice
 experiments suggest that, while the complexity of search may have 
modestly contributed to poor choice, employees’ lack of understanding of
 basic health insurance concepts played a more fundamental role.  We 
find that plan selection is ultimately consistent with a heuristic 
choice strategy whereby individuals sort into available plans based on 
self-assessed health risk rather than a careful financial comparison of 
plan options.  Our results challenge the standard practice of inferring 
risk attitudes, and assessing welfare, from insurance choices, and raise
 doubts as to whether recent reforms that expand choice will deliver 
promised benefits.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12147_abstract">Time
 discounting is at the heart of economic and health decision-making. We 
disentangle hyperbolic discounting from subjective time perception using
 experimental data from incentive-compatible tests to measure time 
preferences, and a set of experimental tasks to measure time perception.
 The two behavioral parameters may be related to two factors that affect
 how we look ahead to future events. The first is that some components 
of time preferences reflect hyperbolic discounting. The second factor is
 that non-constant discounting may also be a reflection of subjective 
time perception: if people’s perception of time follows a near 
logarithmic process (as all other physiological perceptions such as 
heat, sound, and light do) then all existing estimates of individual 
discounting will be mis-measured and incorrectly suggest “hyperbolic” 
discounting, even if discounting over subjective time is constant. To 
test these hypotheses, we first empirically estimate the two distinct 
behavioral parameters using data collected from participants to lab 
experiments. The results support the hypothesis that apparent 
non-constant discounting is largely a reflection of subjective time 
perception. We then look at the links between the estimated parameters 
and a set of variables associated to economic and health 
decision-making.</div>

smoke. Vaping is not harmless but poses much lower risks than smoking. 
Surveys consistently find that many consumers over-estimate the relative
 risks of vaping. Some evidence also suggests that vaping devices might 
be useful for smoking cessation. However, public health advocates are 
concerned that vaping might lead adolescents to initiate smoking and 
promote dual use among adult smokers.  The FDA’s Center for Tobacco 
Products faces difficult tradeoffs to craft electronic-cigarette 
regulations that do more good than harm. This paper contributes new 
evidence on some of the key tradeoffs. We analyze stated preference data
 from an on-line discrete choice experiment where smokers make 
hypothetical choices between cigarettes, a nicotine-replacement product,
 and electronic cigarettes. The attributes of the electronic cigarette 
were varied experimentally and included price, health warnings, and the 
availability of multiple flavors. We use the data to estimate the 
parameters of a random utility-maximization model by mixed logit (random
 coefficients).  We find that health warnings about electronic 
cigarettes reduce stated preferences for the products, although the 
average impact of an FDA-proposed warning is modest. In a partial 
equilibrium welfare analysis, our preliminary results imply that the 
FDA-proposed warning is equivalent to a $0.30 tax. At projected levels 
of national sales for 2015 this corresponds to a welfare loss of about 
$150 million. We estimate larger welfare losses when we extend the 
welfare analysis to include estimates of an unintended consequence of 
the regulation – substitution towards combustible cigarettes, which 
increases the internalities smokers impose on themselves.</div>

 explore the efficiency in the allocation of physical capital and human 
capital across countries. The observed marginal products can differ 
across countries because of differences in technology and in distortions
 (i.e. differences in use of factors) across countries. To identify 
differences in technology, we propose a new data and a simple method to 
estimate output shares of natural resources, and thus adjust the 
estimated marginal products of physical and human capital. With a sample
 of 79 countries from 1970 to 2005, we find that the world has decidedly
 moved in the direction of efficiency in the allocation of physical 
capital, from global output losses around 7% in the 1970s to 2% by 2005.
 This trend is accounted for by domestic capital accumulation, as 
external flows have had little impact. There is also a large degree of 
heterogeneity in the net gains across countries. For example, we find 
larger gains for countries with more interventionist policies. With 
respect to human capital, we uncover much larger global losses from its 
misallocation. Indeed, contrary to physical capital, we find that the 
human capital allocation had worsened over time.</div>

 existing research asserts that enterprise union is inherently weak due 
to its dependence on enterprise and state. This paper argues that this 
structure-centric explanation cannot explain the diversity of enterprise
 unions at firm level. The paper suggests that union efficacy is 
determined by enterprise’s perception of the state-sponsored 
unionization and union chairperson’s ability to make union work. When 
enterprises perceive the state-sponsored unionization as resources, 
enterprise unions led by capable union leaders are more likely to 
develop specialized union functions and engage in effective collective 
action for promoting employees’ economic interest. The paper is based on
 an 8-month fieldwork in the South China, the city of Shenzhen, where 
more than 50 interviews were conducted on enterprise unions, official 
union, labor NGOs, and workers.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14136_abstract">Trade unions have historically represented a social force leading to stronger democratization
in workplaces, thus contributing to a greater balance of power in the employment
relationship. Union presence has thus been associated with reduced wage gaps and
strengthened industrial democracy (Freeman and Medoff, 1984; Freeman 2005). These
findings show that trade unions have aimed at and succeeded in reducing inequalities within
workplaces and, more broadly, in society (Frege and Kelly 2004; Freeman 2005). However,
the last few decades have been marked by profound upheavals leading to increased
inequalities even within nations (Hayter, 2012), in spite of union action in the public policy
area (Aidt and Tzannatos, 2002; Betcherman, 2013). Moreover, in unionized workplaces,
inequalities have emerged or widened. In Quebec, for example, employers have largely
succeeded in reducing the protections traditionally provided to regular employees, in
particular by introducing disparity in treatment clauses (Lauzon-Duguay, Jalette and Hallé
2010). Other disparities have also been observed between these workers and non-standard
workers regarding the various working conditions included in collective agreements (i.e.
wages, seniority, and employee benefits) (Laroche, 2012). Is this a warning that collective
bargaining is no longer able to effectively play its leading role? This paper aims to analyze
the various sources of inequality found in th lective agreements negotiated in unionized
workplaces in Quebec : it will describe the va s forms of disparity observed and identify
the main explanatory factors for these sources of disparity in unionized workplaces (sector,
company size, union affiliation, duration of the contract, etc.). Our analysis is based on data
provided by the Ministry of Labour of Quebec. A database was constructed with these data
deriving from all the collective agreements in force on December 31, 2012, in the private
sector (N=5291). Multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to determine the influence
of the different factors.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14137_abstract">Membership decline and membership concentration have been consistent features of UK
unions for the last 25 years. In 2015, the size distribution of unions is highly skewed, with
a few very large unions accounting for the bulk of membership, but the continued survival
of small organisations. The union movement remains unified in the specific sense that the
bulk of union membership is in unions affiliated to a single apex organisation, the Trades
Union Congress. This paper looks at the strategy-structure relationship for this body of
membership. Specifically, it critically analyses the relationship between the mobilisation
strategy of the TUC and the distribution and use of resources within affiliated unions. The
paper uses two types of data; first interviews and documentary analysis using access to
the TUC and its affliates to establish the key developments in mobilisation strategy, and,
second, analysis of statutory AR21 returns to analyse revenues, expenditures and assets. It
focuses on the period 1980-2015. A key conclusion of the paper is that the two processes,
membership decline and membership concentration, are related in that the mechanisms
of concentration – mergers and amalgamations – divert resources away from attempts
to reverse membership decline. The reduction in influence and coverage of unions as
labour market institutions has some endogenous causes. The paper concludes with some
suggestions for change</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14138_abstract">This paper studies the effects of unionism on the acquisition of employee benefits in
China's urban labor market. Since the 1980s, the economic reform promoted the growth
of real labor market and labor relations in China. Changes of labor market institutions,
introduction of modern management strategies, and welfare legacy have significantly
relocated the distribution structure of benefits. On the one hand, employee benefits still
play an important role in compensation in state-owned workplaces; on the other hand,
near 40% of workers still could not be covered by any benefits. Based on this context,
this research focuses on different employee benefit levels in the Chinese urban labor
market. With the theoretical framework of supply-demand-institution, we analyze the causal
relationship between unionization, including both individual-level and enterprise-level,
and employees' benefit levels. Unlike existing studies mostly using enterprise-level data,
this research utilizes individual-level data like the Chinese General Social Survey and
the Matching Survey of Employers and Employees. This study attempts to address four
questions: 1) Could unionization of workplaces increase employers' provision of benefits?
2) Could unionization of workplaces enhance individual employees' benefits levels? 3) Will
an employee acquire more benefits if he/she joins the union? 4) How does unionization affect
employers' provision and employees' acquisition of benefits, and does the similar causal
relationship exists between unionization and ge level in the context of China’s labor
relations? Through estimation of baseline re sion models, hierarchical linear models, and
propensity score matching, we find that both the unionization of employees and workplaces
is able to enhance one's benefits level. Moreover, it is identified that this positive effect
comes from union’s promotion of workplace democratic participation rather than workers'
collective bargaining power or supervision of labor contract law enforcement. Finally, it is
found that unionization in China has no significant influence on one's wage level.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14160_abstract">Many U.S. businessmen are vocally in favor of an increase in the number of H-1B visas.
Is there systematic evidence that this would positively affect firms’ productivity, sales,
employment or profits? To address these questions we assemble a unique dataset that
matches all labor condition applications (LCAs) – the first step towards H-1B visas for skilled
foreign-born workers in the U.S. – with firm-level data on publicly traded U.S. firms (from
Compustat). Our identification is based on the sharp reduction in the annual H-1B cap that
took place in 2004, combined with information on the degree of dependency on H-1B visas
at the firm level as in Kerr and Lincoln (2010). The main result of this paper is that if the
cap on H-1B visas were relaxed, a subset of firms would experience gains in average labor
productivity, firm size, and profits. These are firms that conduct R&amp;D and are heavy users
of H-1B workers – they belong to the top quintile among filers of LCAs. These empirical
findings are consistent with a heterogeneous firms model where innovation enhances
productivity and is subject to fixed costs.</div>

are the fundamental inputs in scientific innovation and technological adoption which, in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
turn, are the main drivers of the productivity growth in the US. During the last thirty years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
productivity growth appeared to be "college" biased, in that it increased demand and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
productivity of college educated much more than that of other workers. In this paper we&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
identify STEM workers in the US and we look at the effect of their growth on the growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
of wages and employment of college and non-college educated in 219 US cities during&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
the period 1990-2010. In order to identify a supply-driven and heterogeneous increase in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
STEM workers across US cities we use the "dependence" of each city on foreign-born STEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
workers in 1980 (or 1970) and we exploit the introduction and the variation (over time and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
across nationalities) of the H1B visa program directed specifically to allow access into the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
US to professional STEM workers. We find that H1B-driven increases in STEM workers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
in a city were associated with significant increases in wages of college educated natives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(in general as well as STEM). Non-college educated natives, instead, experienced nonsignificant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
effects on their wages and on their employment. We also find evidence that STEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14226_abstract">Considerable
 prior research has shown that the majority of older Americans with 
career employment do not exit the labor force directly from that career 
job. Rather, most move first to another job late in life, before 
complete labor force withdrawal. These intermediate jobs have been 
labeled “bridge jobs”, since they are assumed to be a bridge to complete
 retirement. One criticism of this research is that bridge job activity 
may be overstated because the definition of a bridge job in the existing
 literature does not require a change in occupation. This paper 
investigates the extent to which bridge jobs involve a change in 
occupation or a switch to part-time status, both of which may signal the
 start of a retirement transition, as opposed to continued career 
employment, albeit with a different employer.  We utilize the Health and
 Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally-representative longitudinal 
dataset of older Americans that began in 1992. When all transitions 
after the career job are included, the vast majority of the men and 
women either changed occupations, reduced hours to part time, or both. 
We conclude that, by and large, those who changed jobs later in life did
 in fact do so as part of a retirement transition. Ignoring these 
subtleties does result in an overestimate of bridge job activity, but 
only a modest one.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21643_abstract">The
 article investigates the social causes and consequences of poverty and 
unemployment in minority communities in the U.S. Specifically, we 
investigate three related phenomena: 1) the disproportionate nature of 
unemployment and poverty in minority communities, with specific focus on
 African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities; 2) the 
relation between economic deprivation and income-generating crime; and 
3) how the interacting and disproportionate effects of unemployment, 
poverty, and crime lead to heightened racial tensions within our 
communities. The paper also considers how a Job Guarantee program can 
reduce poverty and unemployment. The Job Guarantee seeks to benefit 
disadvantaged communities by providing the right to employment. 
Progressive policies like a Job Guarantee can aid in narrowing the 
opportunity gap and moving towards a reversal of the current trend of 
disenfranchisement.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21644_abstract">Unemployment
 has always been a central issue in macro and micro. Unemployment means 
that human resources are being wasted, so the economy is not operating 
as well as it could. From a personal point of view it means that people 
are not contributing, not developing their talents (assuming that the 
jobs available would require talents!) and not feeling useful. Nor are 
they supporting their families. It means the economy is not growing as 
fast as it could, which means that technology and innovation are not 
developing as fast as they could. The ELR offers a remedy for these 
ills, no doubt imperfect but better than the usual policies. But we may 
be facing forms of unemployment that cannot be so readily offset - 
namely competition from robots and computer-driven systems. However, ELR
 programs could be adapted to develop new forms of work, and pay can be 
separated from work in the usual sense. But this will require a change 
in social norms, and in economic structure.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21646_abstract">Many
 Job Guarantee programs argue that the financing of the program is not a
 fundamental problem. The program’s funding depends upon a recognition 
that the government is able to spend the financial resources required to
 implement a job guarantee because there are no fundamental constraints 
to government spending, as in a gold-standard world. The value of the 
currency is not strictly determined by the scarcity of the money and 
there is not an operational constraint on the amount of money that can 
be issued. Rather, the value is driven by the fact that the issuer of 
the currency will accept the currency in payments to itself. One can 
always use the money of a sovereign nation to pay taxes, so the money 
will have value. Since establishing a strong taxation system is one of 
the ways that a government may “drive” the value of its currency, the 
scheme of taxation becomes of interest to this line of research. Various
 taxation schemes may be explored to determine a more “effective” tax 
base. Common taxes are income and sales taxes, where the production and 
consumption of goods is taxed. As the concern over both environmental 
waste and resource use become policy concerns, a carbon tax might be a 
useful tax to consider. These taxes are not necessary to “finance” 
government spending, but rather are a necessary means by which a 
significant portion of the population will demand the currency so that 
they may pay their taxes, driving the value of the currency.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21647_abstract">Governments
 have two broad buffer stock options when it comes to price 
stabilization:
(a) Unemployment buffer stocks: Under a mainstream NAIRU regime (the 
current orthodoxy), inflation is controlled using tight monetary and 
fiscal policy, which leads to a buffer stock of unemployment. This is a 
very costly and unreliable target for policy makers to pursue as a means
 for inflation proofing.
(b) Employment buffer stocks: The government exploits the fiscal power 
embodied in a fiat-currency issuing national government to introduce 
full employment based on an employment buffer stock approach. The Job 
Guarantee (JG) model which is central to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is
 an example of an employment buffer stock policy approach.
In this paper, we juxtapose the two buffer stock options from the point 
of inflation control with a discussion of where they fit into the 
literature on the Phillips curve and consider the macroeconomic 
efficiency implications of each. The discussion will consider the 
implications for the fiscal position of the government arising from each
 option.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14315_abstract">Government
 transfers and federal taxes significantly affect the distribution of 
resources available to U.S. households.  But conclusions about how 
redistributive the tax and transfer system are depend on the framework 
used to analyze them, especially the income measure used to rank 
households.
 
Traditionally, distributional analyses of taxes have used a broad 
measure of income—one that includes income from transfers—as the basis 
for ranking households and measuring average tax rates across the income
 distribution. That framework, however, is less suitable for measuring 
the distributional effects of income received from government transfers.
 As refundable credits such as the EITC and the Affordable Care Act’s 
health insurance subsidies continue to blur the line between taxes and 
transfers, an income measure that includes transfers may no longer be 
the most appropriate metric to measure the progressivity of the tax 
system. Furthermore, to ascertain how both government transfers and 
federal taxes affect household well-being across the income spectrum, it
 is necessary to consider an alternate framework for comprehensive 
distributional analyses.

This paper presents a new framework to analyze the combined effects of 
government transfers and federal taxes on the distribution of household 
income. It also explores how alternative distributional presentations 
change conclusions about the progressivity of the tax and transfer 
system compared with the widely-cited framework currently used by the 
Congressional Budget Office in its distributional analyses.</div>

 show that changes in choice architecture have a large effect on student
 loan decisions while we do not find significant effects of sizeable 
interest rate changes. We evaluate the effect of two polices implemented
 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Education:  (1) the requirement that 
all applicants for private student loans fill out a Self-Certification 
Form, which includes various disclosures about federal aid, and (2) the 
prohibition of presenting a private student loan as a default option on a
 financial aid offer without disclosure of the relationship between the 
school and the creditor. Using difference-and-difference and matching 
techniques on a proprietary dataset of private student loan originations
 from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and survey and 
administrative data from the Department of Education, we show that these
 changes decreased private student loan originations by 33\% at public 
four-year institutions, 18\% at private not-for-profit four year 
institutions, and 55\% at four year for-profit institutions. In 
contrast, we find no consumer response when analyzing 60 basis point 
decrease in the price of federal Parental PLUS loans at some schools,

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14317_abstract">This
 paper provides new evidence on how families adjust their labor supply 
in response to the receipt of an anticipated cash transfer. In 
particular, I exploit the unique disbursement timing and benefit rules

receipt of a cash transfer on the timing of family labor supply. My 
results show that income seasonality caused by EITC receipt leads to 
changes in the intra-year labor supply patterns of married women. On 
average, receiving a $1,000 EITC payment significantly reduces the 
proportion of married women who work, by 1.6 percentage points, in the 
month in which the EITC is received. The income elasticity of labor 
supply for married women based on this estimate is around -0.06. In 
contrast, the receipt of the EITC does not affect the timing of the 
labor supply of married men and single women. The subgroup analysis 
suggests families might reduce the labor supply of secondary earners in 
response to receiving an anticipated EITC payment. In addition, My 
results suggest that the presence of liquidity constraints and myopia 
could be important reasons for my findings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14318_abstract">A
 common view of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) is that capital bears an 
effective tax rate of zero because the tax on investment is typically 
immediately refunded.  However, most VAT designs include sectors and 
classes of exempted goods and services, where tax is not paid on their 
sale but taxes are &lt;br /&gt;
still paid on inputs to production.  Because exemption makes it 
impossible for some businesses to fully recover the VAT paid on their 
investment, this can lead to an embedded tax on capital.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
  While theoretical work such as Emran and Stiglitz (2005) and Keen 
(2008) have focused on how a VAT could impose embedded taxes on  
informal sectors, we extend their insights to these exempted formal  
sector firms. Using a nationally representative sample of US tax 
returns, we construct a microsimulation model of a theoretical US 
value-added tax.  We show that common types of exemptions can lead to 
significant embedded taxes for exempted firms.  We then simulate the 
likely response to these embedded taxes and show the differential impact
 it would have among various industries and return types.&lt;br /&gt;</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21747_abstract">One
 of the most important developments in the world economy is the 
globalization of the labor market, in particular, the ability to work 
for a faraway company or customers, without having to apply for 
immigration and without having to travel. This is the unseen driver 
behind a lot that is happening around the world--economic and 
political--and changing the global landscape. In this paper I will 
explore the implication of this underlying change for the growth 
prospects of and challenges for emerging economies, with special focus 
on the Indian economy. It is arguable that the marked increase in 
India's growth rate that occurred from the mid 1990s was largely because
 of the ability of the country to take advantage of the globalization of
 the labor market. What must a developing of nation do to seize the 
opportunity that this creates? How long will this opportunity last? The 
globalization of labor will also give rise to some new challenges. Which
 are the developing countries most likely to be able to tackle these 
challenges and grow? These are the questions that will be examined and 
answered, at least partially, in this paper.</div>

 world economy is gradually recovering from the financial and economic 
crisis that originated in the United States in 2007-2009. A vigorous 
debate has emerged over the possibility that the world will be facing 
“secular stagnation”. To assess the validity of this view I will present
 new projections of world economic growth over the next decade. The 
overall framework is provided the neo-classical theory of economic 
growth. Trends in productivity provide the link to technology. Labor 
inputs provide a link to well-established demographic projections. 
Capital inputs are determined endogenously by saving and investment 
behavior. While growth in emerging economies, especially China and 
India, has recently slowed considerably, these economies are growing 
much more rapidly than the world economy and are becoming steadily more 
important. As a consequence, the growth of the world economy is 
accelerating and this will continue for some time. I will emphasize that
 these intermediate-term projections are characterized by considerable 
uncertainty.</div>

 presentation examines the relationship and influence between the double
 crisis and the rise of ‘greening’ as part of the solution. The aim is 
to understand what defines and distinguishes the proposals contained in 
twenty-four sources on the green economy (including policy documents by 
international agencies and think tanks, and research papers), and what 
is the meaning and implication of the rising greening agenda for 
sustainable development as it enters the 21st century. Through a 
systematic qualitative analysis of textual material, three categories of
 discourse that can illuminate the meaning and implication of greening 
are identified: ‘almost business as usual’, ‘greening’, and ‘all 
change’. An analysis of their relationship with Dryzek’s classification 
of environmental discourse leads to the identification of three 
interrelated patterns: (1) scarcity and limits, (2) means and ends, and 
(3) reductionism and unity—which deepen our understanding of the 
tensions between emerging propositions. The patterns help explain the 
meaning and implications of greening for sustainable development, 
revealing an economization and polarization of discourses, the 
persisting weak interpretation of sustainable development, and a tension
 between the fixing or shifting of dominant socioeconomic paradigms that
 underpin its conceptualization.</div>

 Electricity customers who install solar panels often are paid the

 We conduct an empirical analysis of quality competition between 
broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs), using National Broadband 
Map data for 2011-2013 for almost a thousand local markets in 
California. We examine how incumbent ADSL firms respond to competition 
from CLECs and cable modem service providers. We use an important 
quality attribute, the downstream data rate, and estimate the strategic 
choice of quality for broadband ISPs.  &lt;br /&gt;
 Our paper follows a static game theoretic approach to the profit 
maximization decision of a broadband provider that leads to a simple 
two-stage method of estimation of the structural parameters of the ISPs’
 profit functions.  The method accounts for both the strategic aspect of
 each firm’s quality decision, as well as the endogeneity problems 
inherent in the estimation problem. &lt;br /&gt;
 Our results include two main findings.  First, ILECs improve the 
quality of their ADSL offerings when a cable player enters the market, 
and also when cable operators start to offer DOCSIS 3.0 speeds. Second, 
ILEC ADSL providers do not raise their service quality in response to 
ADSL competition from CLECs, but they do boost their speed when CLECs 
deploy fiber in the market. This research represents the first step in 
what we hope to be a major advance in the empirical analysis of 
broadband provision, where little structural econometric work has been 
done.</div>

 We examine the economics of adaptive behavior in forming and changing 
utility regulatory systems. Independent regulatory agencies dampen the 
effect politics has on investment and diminish information asymmetries. 
Although these effects improve industry performance, creating and 
modifying agencies means either transferring work from other 
organizations to the agency, restricting behaviors that have not been 
restricted before, or both. These changes create personal losses and 
those experiencing the losses resist changes. Using empirical studies

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13939_abstract">Abstract:
 The rapid growth of Uber and other ride-sharing services like Lyft and 
Sidecar has upended the traditional taxicab industry, which is generally
 heavily regulated. Consumers clearly benefit through new entry into 
what has been a highly-protected industry—ride-sharing creates a service
 that simply did not exist a few years ago and almost by definition 
consumers are better off when new services emerge. The benefits to 
consumers, however, are likely to be even larger than might appear based
 on growth of these new companies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In particular, although the most prominent response by taxicab companies
 has been lobbying to slow Uber’s growth, they may also try to win 
customers by competing for them in the market. Because of regulations, 
their competitive responses are limited. Taxi drivers cannot, on their 
own, reduce prices or offer the frictionless payment systems 
ride-sharing services use. Even so, drivers might respond by trying to 
offer higher quality rides than they used to. Improved quality might 
take the form of, for example, being more courteous to passengers by 
turning off the radio, not talking on a cell phone while driving, and so
 on. If ride-sharing has generated this kind of competitive response by 
taxis then even consumers who do not use ride-sharing may benefit.&lt;br
 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this paper I assemble a dataset to test that hypothesis empirically. 
In particular, I test whether the growth in ride-sharing has led to a 
decrease in the number of consumer complaints about taxis. One benefit 
of regulation is that regulators often collect lots of data. And, 
indeed, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) provided 
me with data on every taxi ride in the city from 2010 through 2014. Data
 on taxi complaints comes from NYC’s Open Data Project. Ride-sharing 
companies are private and make little data available. Nevertheless, data
 from Google Trends makes it possible to generate an index of 
ride-sharing’s growing popularity in NYC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The data reveal that, in fact, the number of complaints per taxi trip 
has declined along with the growth of Uber, even when controlling for 
underlying trends and seasonal events that may affect taxi use. Based on
 others’ research on complaints in regulated in regulated industries, 
the results suggest that customers who used to complain now take their 
business elsewhere and also that taxi drivers are responding to 
competition from Uber by increasing the quality of their own 
service.&lt;br /&gt;</div>

 financial crisis that broke out in 2007 revealed the existence of a 
completely parallel funding system outside of regular banking, the 
so-called shadow banking system (SBS). This subject has become a central
 field of academic research with numerous studies seeking to evaluate 
its size, describe the entities involved, assess its role, and possibly 
regulate it somewhat. However, most of these studies focus on the US due
 to a lack of data for Europe. Different features specific to Europe 
make it difficult to just copy and apply the analysis of the US SBS to 
the European situation. Our article focuses on analyzing the distinctive
 features of the European shadow banking system. Using a principal 
component analysis (PCA) we study four different groups of variable 
concerning other financial institutions in 25 European countries. The 
results highlight four different groups of countries that share similar 
characteristics according to the variety of capitalism to which they

 global financial crisis rapidly led to a crisis of the eurozone which 
split the member countries in ways that the diversity of capitalism 
approach did not foresee. What can we learn from this experience? Does 
it invalidate the typology that the diversity of capitalism approach 
retained?  Is it a transitional or lasting change? Can we identify a new
 typology that would fit the experiences of the countries in the last 
five years and help to appreciate how they are likely to behave in the 
years to come? What does it tell on their ability to meet the challenge 
of the transition to more sustainable development path?  To what extent 
the various migration regimes identified around the 1990s and 2000s 
accounted for the current reactions to the inflows of migrants?</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14421_abstract">The
 European Commission has stated that its priority for the coming period 
is to build a single market for capital – a Capital Market Union (CMU) 
for all 28 member states. Accomplishing that would require removing all 
barriers in order to ensure complete free circulation of capital, 
deregulating more, making the capital markets larger, deepening and 
increasing the degree of financial market integration across the EU, and
 developing and encouraging processes such as securitization. The CMU is
 primarily discussed under the heading of "finance for growth". However,
 there is also a second, more long-term or structural goal : to shift 
the European economy with its traditionally strong reliance on bank 
financing to a more market-financed economy with bonds and investment 
funds, similar to the Anglo-American model. This project is not 
consistent with existing institutions in continental Europe. If 
promoted, it would exert a destabilizing effect on the economy and the 
society in Continental Europe.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14561_abstract">In
 this paper we examine the Special Drawing Right (SDR), using a more 
formalized approach based on a Stock Flow Consistent (SFC) model 
initially developed by Godley and Lavoie (2007). The model consists of 
four country blocks (the U.S., the Eurozone, China and the rest of the 
world) with multiple real and financial interactions (international 
trade, portfolio investments, etc.). In order to test the effects of the
 introduction of the SDR as a reserve asset we run different types of 
simulations. A first set of simulations attempt to compare the current 
system (organized upon the U.S dollar as the key currency) with a 
scenario where there is a coordinated decision to enhance the role of 
the SDR as a reserve asset. The second set of simulations aim at 
comparing the present system with one where SDRs are issued 
countercyclically in times of global recessions. Last, the simulations 
also examine the contribution of SDR to monetary stability thanks to an 
enlarged use with new SDR denominated assets or with a role of anchor 
for the rest of the world.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21659_abstract">Refugees
 and asylum seekers are only a small proportion of the 60 million 
forcibly displaced persons. But those seeking asylum in the developed 
world have received much of the attention and Western governments have 
struggled to develop a policy response. An analysis of asylum 
applications by origin and destination indicates that these flows are 
largely driven by political terror and human rights abuses. Poor 
economic conditions in origin countries and tough asylum policies in 
destination countries matter too. In the light of the findings I suggest
 that greater coordination among OECD countries could improve the lot of
 those fleeing from persecution but even this would make small inroads 
on the sum of human misery.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21660_abstract">Crisis
 migration refers to all forms of mobility associated with humanitarian 
crises—that is, any situation in which there is a widespread threat to 
life, physical safety, health or basic subsistence that is beyond the 
coping capacity of individuals and the communities in which they reside.
  Crisis migration is not a legal concept. Rather, the term was coined 
to encompass persons who move as a result of life threatening events and
 processes but do not fall within the legal definition of a 
refugee--that is, a person unable to return to his or her country of 
origin because of a well founded fear of persecution. Hurricanes, 
cyclones, tsunamis, earthquakes, nuclear and industrial accidents, “acts
 of terrorism”, armed conflict, environmental degradation, drought, 
famine, climate change, and situations of generalized violence, gang and
 cartel violence, and political instability are all potential triggers 
of crisis  migration. I discuss  failures in the current protection 
system as well as recent initiatives to fill the gap. I argue that new 
legal and institutional arrangements are needed and provide a framework 
for determining who among crisis migrants are in need of international 
protection.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21662_abstract">Civil
 war in Syria, which started in March 2011, has led to a massive wave of
 forced immigration from the Northern Syria to the Southeastern regions 
of Turkey. The unexpected arrival of a large number of refugees due to 
civil conflict in Syria resembles a natural experiment that generates an
 almost exogenous flow of immigrants, which offers a good opportunity to
 study the economic impact of refugees on the host country. Using 
micro-level data, I focus on three main topics: labor market outcomes, 
consumer prices, and housing markets. I find that the Syrian refugee 
inflows have considerably affected the employment outcomes of natives 
living in the hosting regions of Turkey. I document notable employment 
losses among informal native workers, which suggests that the informal 
native workers are substituted by informally employed refugees.&nbsp;The
 prevalence of informal employment in the Turkish labor markets has 
amplified the negative impact of Syrian refugee inflows on natives’ 
labor market outcomes. I also find that the prices of the goods and 
services produced in the informal-labor intensive sectors have declined 
due to the wage-cost advantages generated by the refugee penetration to 
the informal labor market. Finally, I report that the market for housing
 rentals has also been affected by refugee inflows. In particular, I 
find that the refugee inflows have led to an increase in the rents of 
higher quality housing units, while there is no effect in the rents of 
lower quality units. This finding supports a residential segregation 
story, which suggests that the refugee wave has increased the demand for
 better and safer neighborhoods especially among natives. Overall, the 
inflow of Syrian refugees is shown to affect a wide range of economic 
outcomes of the natives residing in the hosting regions of Turkey.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13078_abstract">This
 paper reports on the results of two field experiments examining the 
impact of providing information on how a consumer’s own electricity use 
translates into its monthly electricity bill on how that consumer 
responds to a nonlinear retail price schedule for electricity. Across 
the two utilities, over 2,000 consumers participated in a customized 
on-line interactive educational program that taught them how their 
monthly electricity bill was determined from nonlinear retail price 
schedule they face. Each consumer was also told where their typical 
consumption monthly places it on this nonlinear pricing schedule. 
Consumers were also shown how changes in their major 
electricity-consuming activities would affect their monthly bill under 
the nonlinear price schedule. Using data from before and after this 
intervention for consumers that took the educational program (our 
treatment) and a randomly selected set of control consumers, we estimate
 the overall treatment effect associated with our educational program as
 well as a treatment effect for consumers on each specific pricing tier 
on the nonlinear price schedule during the pre-intervention period. For 
both utilities, we find that the overall impact of our treatment is a 
reduction in the consumer’s daily average consumption. In addition, our 
price tier-specific treatment effect results are that consumers that 
learn they face a higher marginal price for consuming electricity reduce
 their electricity consumption and consumers that learn they face the 
lowest marginal price increase their electricity consumption. These 
results emphasize that the need to provide timely and actionable 
information to consumers in order to maximize the effectiveness of 
nonlinear retail price schemes.</div>

 and imperfect information bias behavior towards the salient and 
immediately visible. They drive individuals to lose sight of long-term 
goals, such as leading a sustainable and healthy life, and promote 
overindulgence and waste. We show that providing real-time feedback on a
 specific resource intense behavior can be a powerful remedy for this 
bias: In a large-scale field experiment, participants receive real-time 
feedback on their resource use. We find that this approach reduced 
resource consumption by 22% - much larger conservation gains than 
conventional policy interventions achieve. Real-time feedback directly 
overcomes salience bias, and avoids the negative psychological pressure 
that has been observed with widely-used policy interventions. Providing 
real-time feedback has the potential for cost-effective policy 
interventions aimed at resource conservation, and could help individuals
 eliminate salience bias in other domains of life.</div>

 persuasion and appeals could be an effective nudge to encourage parents
 to change their energy consumption behavior. Using the experimental 
setting of “Project Carbon Zero” (PCZ) campaign, an energy saving 
contest for schools in Singapore, this study is the first to empirically
 test the effectiveness of school children’s nudges in bringing 
electricity conservation messages back to families and neighbors. Using a
 simple difference-in-difference approach that relies on the time of 
implementation of the PCZ campaign and the home-school distance measure 
as identification, we found that the behavioral intervention reduced the
 electricity consumption of the treated housing blocks by 1.8% relative 
to the control housing blocks during the contest months. The electricity
 savings effects persisted into the post-campaign months with estimated 
marginal savings of 1.6% between households in a 2km radius from the 
schools (the treatment group) and those located outside the school zone 
(the control group). We find no significant income effects in the 
private housing, but strong income effect in the public housing. 
However, the building design effect could influence the energy saving 
behaviors of families in private housing.</div>

 model in which homebuyers make a modest approximation leads house 
prices to display three features present in the data but usually missing
 from perfectly rational models: momentum at one-year horizons, mean 
reversion at five-year horizons, and excess longer-term volatility 
relative to fundamentals. Valuing a house involves forecasting the 
current and future demand to live in the surrounding area. Buyers 
forecast using past transaction prices. Approximating buyers assume that
 past prices reflect only contemporaneous demand, just like professional
 economists who use trends in housing prices to infer trends in housing 
demand. Consistent with survey evidence, this approximation leads buyers
 to expect increases in the market value of their homes after recent 
house price increases, to fail to anticipate the price busts that follow
 booms, and to be overconfident about the accuracy of their assessments

 by an intriguing observation during the recent U.S. housing cycle that

 a model to analyze information aggregation and learning in housing

 specify a model of housing markets in which homebuyers cannot directly 
observe market demand but infer it using observed prices and their own 
private valuations. Demand shocks are incorporated into market prices 
gradually when demand is not directly observable, providing an 
explanation for the short-run momentum and long-run mean reversion 
observed in the data. To characterize the effects of speculation, we 
compare prices in markets without speculation and markets in which 
better-informed speculators trade against less-informed buyers. We show 
that asset bubbles can form when buyers are unaware of speculative 
activity and relatively uniformed about market demand. Under these 
conditions, ordinary buyers mistake speculator-driven price growth for 
positive demand shocks, resulting in a self-fulfilling cycle of 
speculative purchasing and increasingly biased buyer beliefs. 
Conversely, speculation increases price efficiency if buyers account for
 speculation when forming beliefs or information asymmetries between 
buyers and speculators are small.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10113_abstract">How
 do corporate tax incentives affect firms' investment? Employing 
confidential UK corporate tax returns (2001/02-2009/10), we provide new 
evidence on the effects of capital allowances. We exploit exogenous 
changes in the qualifying thresholds for first year accelerated capital 
allowances (FYAs) to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis. 
Results suggest that gross investment rate increased between 2.1 and 2.6
 percentage points when firms became qualified for FYAs, relative to 
firms that never qualified. Exploiting exogenous heterogeneity in firms'
 characteristics, we show that the cash flow channel through which 
capital allowances affect investment is not of first order importance. 
We then identify the presence of adjustment costs as firms do not react 
immediately to higher capital allowances. They react relatively quickly 
(in up to 12/18 months), though. Finally, larger capital allowances for 
small and medium-sized companies create notches. We identify a small 
number of firms bunching just below the qualifying thresholds for FYAs. 
Such companies do not drive our results: incentives are effective for a 
wide group of firms and not only for those manipulating their size 
indicators.</div>

 contribute to the empirical literature on the relationship between 
corporate taxes and investment.
We exploit the introduction of the so-called ACE corporate tax reform in
 Belgium that came into effect in January 2006 to evaluate this 
relationship in a quasi-experimental setting based on firm-level 
accounting data. To identify the causal effect of the reform on capital 
spending of Belgian corporations, we focus on the indirect effect of 
taxes on investment via their impact on free cash-flow. We use the 
systematic variation of the cash-flow sensitivity of investment between 
small and medium versus large firms to form treatment and control groups
 for difference-in-differences (DiD) estimations.

Our benchmark results provide highly significant and robust estimates 
that correspond to an increase in investment activity by small and 
medium-sized firms of about 3 percent in response to the ACE reform.
We substantiate the robustness of our results by means of triple 
differences estimations (DDD) that use a matched sample of French 
companies as an additional dimension of contrast.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11300_abstract">This
 paper uses millions of U.S. federal income tax returns to measure 
individual taxpayer bunching at kink points in federal income tax 
schedules, and translates bunching patterns into estimates of tax rate 
sensitivity. We make two primary contributions to the modern public 
finance literature estimating the sensitivity of taxable income to 
marginal tax rates. First, we provide evidence of substantial 
heterogeneity in responsiveness across household types. Second, we 
document changes in tax rate sensitivity over a sixteen year period 
(1996 to 2011) that includes the Bush Tax Cuts and several business 
cycle fluctuations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We find a striking absence of bunching at most of the kinks we analyze,
 with some important exceptions. Consistent with Saez (2010) and Chetty 
et al. (2013), we find sharp bunching at the first kink in the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC) schedule. The strongest results are for 
self-employed taxpayers with one child. For these households we 
calculate observed elasticities as large as 0.68. Most other groups 
exhibit lesser degrees of bunching at this kink, with elasticities no 
larger than 0.16. We document small, visually evident, statistically 
significant bunching among wage earners - a novel finding in the U.S. 
In contrast to prior research, we also find consistent evidence of 
bunching among married taxpayers - both self-employed and wage earners -
 at the second kink in the federal ordinary income schedule.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We then analyze the evolution of elasticities over time. Thus far we 
have limited our analysis to the EITC. The most responsive groups 
exhibit patterns over time that suggest bunching is positively 
correlated with the business cycle. The Great Recession drastically 
reduced bunching for these groups, though subsequent years saw a return 
to pre-recession bunching levels. These results have implications for 
policymakers considering using tax policy in response to negative 
business cycle shocks.</div>

 study the effect of going-concern contingent capital on bank risk 
choice. Optimal conversion ahead of default forces deleveraging in 
highly levered states, when risk incentives are worse. The equity 
infusion reduces endogenous risk shifting by diluting returns in high 
states. Interestingly, contingent capital may be less risky in 
equilibrium than traditional debt, as its lower priority is compensated 
by reduced endogenous risk. Its effectiveness in risk reduction depends 
critically on the informativeness of the trigger. We show that adopting a

 capital in the form of debt that converts to equity as a bank 
approaches financial distress offers a potential solution to the problem
 of banks that are too big to fail. This paper studies the design of 
contingent convertible bonds and their incentive effects in a structural
 model with endogenous default, debt rollover, and tail risk in the form
 of downward jumps in asset value. We show that once a firm issues 
contingent convertibles, the shareholders’ optimal bankruptcy boundary 
can be at one of two levels: a lower level with a lower default risk or a
 higher level at which default precedes conversion. An increase in the 
firm’s total debt load can move the firm from the first regime to the 
second, a phenomenon we call debt-induced collapse because it is 
accompanied by a sharp drop in equity value. We show that setting the 
contractual trigger for conversion sufficiently high avoids this hazard.
 With this condition in place, we investigate the effect of contingent 
capital and debt maturity on capital structure, debt overhang, and asset
 substitution. We also calibrate the model to past data on the largest 
U.S. bank holding companies to see what impact contingent convertible 
debt might have had under the conditions of the financial crisis.</div>

 conduct a first comprehensive empirical study on the bank contingent 
convertible (CoCo) issues market. Two main findings emerge from our 
study. First, the impact of CoCo issuance on CDS spreads is negative and
 statistically significant indicating that CoCo issuance reduces banks’ 
credit risk. The reduction in CDS spreads is much larger for mandatory 
conversion (MC) CoCos than for principal write-down (PWD) issues. The 
impact on CDS spreads for G-SIB issuers tends to be considerably 
stronger in the lead-up to issuance than on and after the issue date. In
 contrast to CDS spreads there is no significant impact on equity prices
 of CoCo issuers. Second, analysis of banks’ securities pricing post 
CoCo issuance reveals that investors in CoCos view instruments as risky 
and place a significant likelihood on the possibility of conversion. 
Thus while CoCos provide capital buffer to banks, the effect on reducing
 risk-taking incentives is rather weak.</div>

institution leverage. Moreover, banks that trigger permanent debt 
reliefs exhibit higher economic performance than the ones that do not. 
These findings point towards innovative debt instruments offering an 
effective solution to the dilemma of bank capital regulation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13279_abstract">With
 the impending  introduction of real-time clearing systems, the phasing 
out of paper currency has become both inevitable and desirable.  Paper 
currency now accounts for an increasingly small share of transactions in
 advanced economies, with tax evasion activities and illegal activities 
accounting for the vast bulk of holdings of paper currency holdings.  
Paper currency also leads to an artificial zero bound on central bank 
policy rates.  However, as paper currency disappears, it raises 
fundamental questions about the governments role in provision of 
transactions media, and how private electronic monies should be 
regulated, including especially what kinds of anonymous transactions 
media should be allowed. These issues have important implications for 
central bank independence, price stability and government  debt 
management.  This paper develops a simple framework for analyzing these 
issues.</div>

 the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, there has been rapid development in the 
area of private digital currencies, in which payments are made over 
ledgers that are shared over a decentralised network.  This paper 
explores the macroeconomic consequences of central banks themselves 
issuing digital currency in sizeable amounts, in direct competition with
 privately-issued bank deposits.  We find that this introduction would 
lead to an increase in the steady state level of output and and an 
improvement in the central bank's ability to stabilise inflation and the
 business cycle.  We believe that it would also help to ameliorate some 
important risks to financial stability, but may also lead to the

 has been much discussion about eliminating the “zero lower bound” by 
eliminating paper currency. But such a radical and difficult approach as
 eliminating paper currency is not necessary. Much as during the Great 
Depression—when countries were able to revive their economies by going 
off the gold standard—all that is needed to empower monetary policy to 
cut interest rates as much as needed for economic stimulus now is to 
change from a paper standard to an electronic money standard, and to be 
willing to have paper currency go away from par. This paper develops the
 idea further and shows how such a mechanism can be implemented in a 
minimalist way by using a time-varying paper currency deposit fee 
between private banks and the central bank. This allows the central bank
 to create a crawling-peg exchange rate between paper currency and 
electronic money; the paper currency interest rate can be either lowered
 below zero or raised above zero. Such an ability to vary the paper 
currency interest rate along with other key interest rates, makes it 
possible to stimulate investment and net exports as much as needed to 
revive the economy, even when inflation, interest rates, and economic 
activity are quite low, as they are currently in many countries. The 
paper also examines different options available to the central bank to 
return to par when negative interest rates are no longer needed, and the
 associated implications for the financial sector and debt contracts. 
Finally, the paper discusses various legal, political, and economic 
challenges of putting in place such a framework and how policymakers 
could address them. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14502_abstract">In
 this paper, I present a novel STEM gender gap measure to document when 
gender differentials emerge and what factors may aid in their reduction.
 I construct a dataset of over 17,000 California State Science Fair 
(CSSF) participants and use students’ choices in project type, which 
places them in one of up to 24 categories. I then evaluate the role of 
several factors that may influence participation and performance gender 
gaps: advisor gender, parent assistance, school-level teacher gender 
composition, and judge gender composition. Although approximately an 
equal number of males and females participate in the overall CSSF, I 
find significant gender gaps in middle school that become more apparent 
among high school students. For example, middle school females are 28.5 
percentage points less likely to compete in a math category, relative to
 social science, compared to 38.5 percentage points in high school. 
However, among winners, gender gaps do not exist in technology, 
engineering, and mathematics fields, where females are least 
represented. In terms of influential factors, I find that advisor or 
parent gender is significant both for project type and performance. For 
example, students who receive assistance from female advisors or mothers
 are significantly less likely to compete in male-dominated fields, like
 engineering or technology. This is important because female 
participants are significantly more likely to receive assistance from 
other females. I do not find evidence to suggest that the general gender
 composition of school teachers influences students’ project decisions 
or performance. Finally, the gender composition of category judges does 
not predict performance.</div>

 analyze the intergenerational transmission of education in a 
three-generation sample of women from the US. The studied cohorts were 
born between the early 1910s and the early 1980s, a period of 
transformational increases in female educational attainment, making this
 an especially interesting context in which to study multigenerational

with the association between the education of grandmothers and their 
granddaughters approximately two-times stronger than would be expected 
under the type of first-order auto regressive transmission structure 
that has been assumed in much of the existing two-generation mobility 
literature. To better understand these findings we outline a simple 
theoretical transmission structure that is consistent with strong

grandparents may directly influence the education of their 
grandchildren, and investigate the extent to which demographic processes
 such as differential fertility impact multigenerational educational 
persistence.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12928_abstract">In
 this paper we confront the data with the folk wisdom of financial 
markets that monetary policy is one of the key drivers of exchange 
rates. We document strong links between exchange rate changes and 
contemporaneous changes in both relative short-term interest rates and 
long-term yields. We then analyze these relationships by using a method 
adapted from Campbell and Shiller (1988a,b) to decompose the exchange 
rate change into a lagged currency risk premium, lagged relative policy 
rates and contemporaneous forward-looking terms, the most relevant being
 terms capturing unanticipated contemporaneous policy and changes in 
expectations over the path of future policy. We decompose these monetary
 policy components further to capture systematic and non-systematic 
components of policy surprises as well as changes in expectations of the
 path of future policy that is orthogonal to current policy. We estimate
 how the exchange rate change responds to each respective monetary 
policy component. We find that one percentage point increase of the 
unanticipated part of the policy rate of country i relative to country 
j, has been associated with an average appreciation of currency i by 19 
percentage points. We can attribute the large coefficients to a large 
degree to the high persistence of policy rates. We also estimate the 
fraction of the variation in exchange rate changes that can be 
attributed to monetary policy and find that in many cases it explains 
10-20% of the variation of exchange rate changes, with the highest 
percentage exceeding 60%.</div>

more foreign currency debt, thereby enhancing inflation credibility at 
the cost of higher default. Low credibility also limits the government's
 ability to offset cost-push shocks, leading to high inflation 
recessions, and pro-cyclical bond returns. In a panel of 30 emerging and
 developed countries, we use local currency bond-stock betas, nominal 
bond yields, inflation and CDS spreads to construct a monetary policy 
credibility rank and show that it is highly correlated with average

 endogenize capital accumulation within a standard model of exchange

appreciate when the marginal utility of traded goods is high and are 
thus better hedges against the consumption risk faced by international

capital, accumulate more capital per worker and pay higher wages than 
less systematic countries. We estimate our model using data from OECD 
countries with freely floating exchange rate regimes 1984-2010 and show 
that cross-currency variation in the stochastic properties of exchange

 an interconnected world, national economic policies lead to 
international spillover effects. This has recently raised concerns about
 global currency wars. However, we show that international spillover 
effects are Pareto efficient and that there is no role for global 
coordination if three benchmark conditions are met: (i) national 
policymakers act as price-takers in the international market, (ii) 
national policymakers possess a complete set of instruments to control 
the external transactions of their country and (iii) there are no 
imperfections in international markets. Examples for national economic 
policies that are efficient under these conditions include exchange rate
 stabilization, competitive depreciations to combat a liquidity trap, or
 reserve accumulation in an economy that experiences 
learning-by-exporting externalities. Conversely, global cooperation is 
needed if one of the three conditions is violated. We provide guidelines
 for how cooperation can improve welfare when countries engage in 
beggar-thy-neighbor policies, have imperfect instruments, or when there 
are imperfections in international markets.</div>

forward guidance announcements on a broad cross section of financial 
markets data and professional forecasts. We find that FOMC announcements
 containing forward guidance had heterogeneous effects depending on the 
other content of the statement. We show that once we control for these 
other elements, forward guidance had, on average, positive and 
meaningful effects on output and inflation expectations. Using this 
benchmark, we then show that standard medium-scale DSGE models tend to 
grossly overestimate the impact of forward guidance on the macroeconomy,

 is the case and show that incorporating a perpetual youth structure

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10771_abstract">The
 effectiveness of forward guidance depends crucially on the credibility 
of the central bank. Instead of assuming full commitment or full 
discretion of the central bank, this paper sheds light on the best 
credible forward guidance policy a central bank can offer by solving for
 the whole set of sustainable sequential equilibria (SSE) in a standard 
New Keynesian model with the occasionally binding constraint of a 
nominal interest rate of zero.The inflation bias resulting from 
eliminating price distortion under the best SSE is much smaller than the
 bias under full discretion. In the presence of the zero lower bound 
(ZLB), while the full commitment solution implies that forward guidance 
has a longer duration of the nominal rate at zero bound followed by a 
quick revert-to-normal path, the best SSE features low but non-zero 
rates, and even a prolonged period of higher inflation after the 
recession ends. The forward guidance policy under the best SSE can close
 output gap during recessions comparable to that under full commitment. 
To make forward guidance credible and as stimulative as possible, the 
adjustment of policy rates should be smooth and gradual. The full 
commitment (Ramsey) equilibria are not generally implementable.</div>

 paper examines the economic effects of forward guidance using a New 
Keynesian model with a zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint on the 
short-term nominal interest rate. Forward guidance is modeled with 
anticipated news shocks to the monetary policy rule. There are five key 
findings: (1) the stimulative effect of forward guidance falls as the 
economy deteriorates or as households expect a slower recovery because 
there is a smaller margin to lower expected policy rates; (2) longer 
forward guidance horizons do not generate increasingly larger impact 
effects on output when the total amount of news is fixed, unlike with an
 exogenous interest rate peg; (3) in steady state, an unanticipated 
shock has a larger impact effect on output than a news shock, but a news
 shock has a larger cumulative effect in every state of the economy; (4)
 at the ZLB, the cumulative effect on output from lengthening the 
forward guidance horizon increases over short horizons but decreases 
thereafter, which indicates the central bank faces limits on how far 
forward guidance can extend into the future and continue to add 
stimulus; and (5) forward guidance is stimulative in the absence of 
other shocks, but the observed effect on output is smaller or even 
negative if another shock simultaneously reduces demand.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12075_abstract">Recent
 theoretical research has emphasized that the effects of monetary policy
 interventions depend on how central bank announcements are perceived by
 agents.  Issues like credibility and anchoring of expectations feature 
routinely in the monetary policy debate.  Central Banks have repeatedly 
tried to influence market expectations of future levels of interest 
rates and inflations, by announcing the general rules that will guide 
the future choices.  This forward guidance is effective only if agents 
trust the central bank and regard its announcements as credible. We 
refer to this as the credibility channel of monetary policy. &lt;br 
/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To identify the importance of this credibility channel we exploit a 
unique dataset on Italian households and firms. Agents residing in 
different Italian regions exhibit important differences in how much they
 trust European institutions.  This variation is used to test the 
credibility channel of monetary policy. The idea is that the effects of 
monetary policy announcements should be different in different regions 
as a function of the level of trust which local agents have in the ECB. 
 We test whether the effects of ECB announcements on employment, actual 
inflation, and inflation expectations vary depending on how credible the
 ECB is perceived by agents.  Given the large variation in the 
credibility of the ECB across regions and provinces, Italy represents a 
unique environment to identify when and how the credibility of the ECB 
matters for monetary policy. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We complement our empirical analysis with a model of endogenous 
attention decision to policy announcements. The model predicts that in 
normal times, regions with higher level of trust should pay less 
attention to monetary policy announcements. In contrast, in a liquidity 
trap, these regions should pay more attention and respond more to policy
 announcements and, in particular, forward guidance.</div>

 consider a New Keynesian model of a small open economy where 
international financial markets are imperfect and the exchange rate is 
determined by capital flows. I use this framework to study the effects 
of exchange rate fluctuations driven by capital flows and characterize 
the optimal foreign exchange intervention. Capital flows shocks cause 
inefficient exchange rate fluctuations that trigger boom-bust cycles in 
the domestic economy. The optimal policy response is to partially 
stabilize these fluctuations using both foreign exchange intervention 
and monetary policy. The optimal foreign exchange intervention leans 
against the wind and stabilizes the path of the exchange rate: following
 an increase (decrease) in the foreign demand for domestic assets, the 
central bank increases (decreases) their net supply and accumulates 
(decumulates) foreign reserves. By doing so the central bank stabilizes 
the path of the exchange rate and smooths out fluctuations in domestic 
consumption. Simultaneously, the central bank reduces (increases) the 
nominal interest rate in order to reduce the relative price of domestic 
goods and mitigate the output gap. Foreign exchange intervention is not a
 mere substitute for monetary policy. Rather, the two tools complement 
each other.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13041_abstract">This
 paper takes stock of how economics has incorporated identity into 
research and thinking and argues for further study of the power of 
social motivations for economic decisions.  In the last decade, new 
empirical and experimental research has shown that identity and societal
 norms affect labor supply, risk attitudes, and other basic economic 
outcomes.  New theoretical work delves into the micro foundations of 
identity-based preferences and into the implications for institutions. 

This paper builds on the original work in identity economics and on this
 new research to show how economics can and why economics should forge a
 new, empirically based, model of human motivation.  This modeling 
privileges the reasons behind people’s decision, whatever motivation 
people might have, not what is typically assumed in standard models.  
This modeling not only generates better predictions – it gives a 
rhetorical credence to economic inquiry.

The paper then elaborates on how identity economics model behavior at a 
variety of frequencies. On the one hand, identity economics describes 
rather long-term and stable picture of the self, with indelible 
identities as gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture.  But 
identity economics also, fractally, describes how people conceive of 
themselves at much shorter frequencies: in the day to day transitions 
between home and work, for example. Identity economics then conveniently
 allows for time-inconsistencies, as different cues, either by design or
 by chance, shift identities, and, correspondingly, shift behavior.  
This perspective follows the findings and point of view of narrative 
psychology.</div>

 on seminal work by Akerlof and Kranton (2000, 2010), we analyze the 
collective production of identity. Personal identity, how one perceives 
oneself, can be cultivated through social interactions in close-knit 
groups.  Social identity, how one is perceived by others, can take the 
form of collective reputation and be cultivated through group 
membership. We show that a single model can be used to analyze the 
collective production of both personal and social identity. This 
framework is used to analyze the economics of organizations that 
cultivate identity, which we call identity-based organizations. In doing
 so, we incorporate into the economics of identity insights from the 
economics of religion and cultural transmission.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13043_abstract">Individuals
 use various criteria to judge themselves and others.  Examples include 
judgments based on ability, task performance, and rules adherence.  
Economic models reflect the idea of multiple criteria upon which people 
are judged: in some, agents are judged based upon type (Bernheim (1994),
 Benabou and Tirole (2002)); in others, agents are judged based upon 
choice of action (Akerlof and Kranton (2000), Benabou and Tirole 
(2011)).  While there appear to be a number of criteria that people 
consider “admissible," there are some that seem to be considered 
“inadmissible.”  For instance: people often take into account the 
weather in judging the performance of athletes, consider it inadmissible
 to judge athletes based upon the weather alone.  This raises the 
question: what makes a criterion admissible/inadmissible?

This paper attempts to characterize the set of admissible criteria.  We 
distinguish between the ex ante and ex post bases upon which agents are 
judged.  Agents might, for example, be judged ex ante based upon choice 
of action.  However, ex post – or, put differently, on the equilibrium 
path – the way in which agents are judged might conceivably reflect 
their types.  The set of admissible criteria are those with the property
 that, ex post, judgments reflect agents’ types – or certain admissible 
aspects of type, which we refer to as “character.”

This proposition explains a mystery: why people take pride in group – as
 well as individual -- accomplishments (take, for instance, sports fans 
or citizens of a country).  It is “admissible,” according to the 
proposition, to base judgments on group accomplishments provided those 
accomplishments reflect the shared character of group members.  A 
precise understanding of “group identity” follows: since 
“identification” involves seeing the group as an important source of 
pride/esteem.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13044_abstract">The
 paper seeks to extend the economics of identity by considering (a) a 
variety of motives underlying social cooperation and social divisions, 
(b) the social and environmental stimuli that activate these different 
motives, (c) personality traits that account for individual differences 
in motivational responsiveness to given stimuli, and (d) the evolution 
of identities arising from the reflexive interaction between individual 
actions and group pressures.

In the simplest interpretation of identity economics at present, social 
identities rest primarily on the motive of social affiliation; social 
interactions are centered on the realization of norms and ideals; and 
economic decisions take account not only pecuniary incentives, but also 
the degree to which social norms and ideals are attained. The paper 
extends this theory by considering a variety of motives (in addition to 
affiliation) that induce people to cooperate within social groups and 
not cooperate across social groups, thereby providing a micro foundation
 for identity formation.

This contribution sheds light on the economic causes and consequences of
 identity formation, leading to distinctive policy implications. The 
analysis suggests that mainstream economics, through its emphasis on 
pecuniary incentives, overlooks the role of internal change agents (such
 as mental training and motivation-oriented education) and external 
change agents (choice architecture and design of social situations) in 
shaping identities and thereby affecting economic decision making. The 
mainstream focus on pecuniary incentives also ignores the influence of 
such incentives on the identity-related motives underlying economic</div>

 growing number of U.S. states have adopted “millionaire taxes” on top 
income earners. This increases the progressivity of state tax systems, 
but raises concerns about tax flight: elites migrating from higher-tax 
to lower-tax states, draining state revenues and undermining 
redistributive policies. Are top income-earners “transitory 
millionaires” searching for lower-tax places to live? Or are they 
“embedded elites” that are reluctant to migrate away from places where 
they have been highly successful? This question is central to 
understanding the economic and social consequences of progressive 
taxation. We draw on administrative tax returns for all million-dollar 
income earners in the United States over 13 years, tracking the state 
from which millionaires file their taxes. The data set contains 43 
million tax records and provides census-scale panel data on top 
income-earners. We advance two core analyses: (1) state-to-state 
migration of millionaires over the long-term, and (2) a sharply-focused 
discontinuity analysis of millionaire population along the borders of 
states. We find limited evidence of millionaire tax flight across states
 in the U.S, with elasticities around 0.1.</div>

 models and central bankers often emphasize anchored inflation 
expectations as a key benefit of inflation targeting. Using a unique 
survey of firms in New Zealand--a country with 25 years of experience in
 successful inflation targeting--we document that inflation expectations
 are far from being anchored. First, inflation expectations as well as 
inflation backcasts depart radically from the official target. Second, 
long-term inflation expectations are highly volatile and correlated with
 short-term inflation expectations. Third, firms have large uncertainty 
about future inflation. Finally, firms are largely unaware of the 
central bank's policies and objectives. We argue that these facts can be
 rationalized in the rational inattention framework and use a randomized
 experiment to show that significant gains in anchoring inflation 
expectations can be achieved if the central bank enhances its

consumption goods. Households that expect inflation to increase are 8% 
more likely to have a positive spending attitude compared to households 
that expect constant or decreasing inflation. This positive association 
is higher for more educated households, working-age households, 
high-income households, and urban households. We use novel German survey
 data for the period from 2000 to 2013 to establish these facts. To 
obtain identification, we exploit an unexpected shock to households' 
inflation expectations: the newly-appointed administration unexpectedly 
announced in November 2005 a three percentage point increase in the 
value-added tax (VAT) effective in 2007. The unexpected VAT increase led
 to an exogenous increase in inflation expectations which had a large 
positive effect on the willingness to spend on durables. Our findings 
suggest that fiscal and monetary policy measures that engineer higher 
inflation expectations may be successful in stimulating consumption 
expenditures.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10561_abstract">Understanding
 inflation expectations is an integral part of understanding asset 
pricing and real economic decisions. We study the role of inflation 
experience in the formation of inflation expectations by investigating 
whether and to what extent inflation expectations of different 
forecasters are affected by the inflation they observe in the area they 
are residing in. In particular, we focus on the expectations of 
professional forecasters from different countries of euro area inflation
 and ask whether their forecast errors are correlated with the observed 
inflation in the forecaster’s country at the time the expectation was 
formed. We find that forecasters perceive the world to be more spatially
 correlated than it actually is: higher inflation in the home country 
leads to abnormally--in the rational expectations sense--higher 
expectations of future euro area inflation that result in more 
pronounced and forecastable forecast errors. This has important 
implications for asset pricing in internationally diversified portfolios
 and correlations of international asset prices.</div>

 frictions play a central role in the formation of household inflation

this question with novel evidence from survey experiments. We document 
two main findings. First, individuals in lower-inflation contexts have 
significantly weaker priors about the inflation rate. This finding 
suggests that rational inattention may be an important source of 
information frictions. Second, cognitive limitations also appear to be a
 source of information frictions: even when information about inflation 
statistics is made readily available, individuals still place a 
significant weight on less accurate sources of information, such as 
their memories of the price changes of the supermarket products they

 analyze the effects and interactions of monetary policy tools that

more productive agents endogenously expose themselves to higher interim

conventional monetary policy and ex-post unconventional monetary policy 
stimulate aggregate investment, individual agents differ in the strength

ex-post policy can be more effective in stimulating output by directly 
affecting liquidity risk, which more productive agents are more exposed 
to. However, when agents can hoard liquidity for asset purchases in the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14007_abstract">We
 examine the causal impact of bank account ownership on adolescents’ 
financial literacy using data from 18 countries that participated in the
 2012 PISA financial literacy assessment. This is an important topic 
because financial literacy early in life is associated with positive 
economic outcomes in adulthood, such as higher saving and better debt 
management. Moreover, bank accounts are the most basic financial 
instruments all over the world, and access to them could be influenced 
by policy. While the data are very rich, identifying the impact of bank 
account ownership on financial literacy is difficult, due, for example, 
to reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity. We address these 
problems by using nonparametric partial identification methods that 
bound the effect of bank accounts on financial literacy, while making 
weak assumptions about the data. These methods allow us to generate 
bounds for both the average and the quantile treatment effects. We find 
that bank account ownership has a significant positive effect on 
adolescents’ financial literacy, with the lower bound of the average 
treatment effect being about 0.15 standard deviations of the financial 
literacy score. We also find economically relevant effects at various 
quantiles of the test score distribution, with Western European and 
Anglo-Saxon countries exhibiting stronger effects at higher quantiles; 
however, the opposite is true for Eastern European countries. Moreover, 
we find stronger effects at higher quantiles for students with higher 
socio-economic background, while students from less privileged 
backgrounds exhibit stronger effects at lower quantiles. These findings 
have implications for both research and policy; promoting access and 
encouraging the use of bank accounts can improve financial literacy both
 in adolescence and later in life.</div>

where gender differences in financial literacy among students are more 
pronounced. Interestingly, the differences become even stronger among 
top performers.  In our empirical analysis, we examine the determinants 
of the gender gap and look at how it varies by school types and school 
environment, family background, and geographical regions. That allows us
 to assess the relative importance of the peer/school effect and of 
socio-economic characteristics in determining the different financial 
literacy scores attained by male and female students in Italy. Using the
 results of the PISA survey combined with data from many other sources, 
we are also able to study the importance of factors related to cultural

gender differences across regions in Italy.</div>

 estimate the impact on objective measures of financial literacy of a 
10-hours financial education program among 15-year old students in 
compulsory secondary schooling. We use a matched sample of students and 
teachers in Madrid and two different estimation strategies. Firstly, we 
use reweighting estimators to compare the performance in a test of 
financial knowledge of students in treatment and control schools. In 
another specification, we use school fixed-effect estimates of the 
effect of the course on change in the score in tests of financial 
knowledge. The program increased treated students financial knowledge by
 between one fourth and one third of a standard deviation. We uncover 
heterogeneous effects, as students in private schools did not increase 
their knowledge much, possibly due to a less intensive implementation of
 the program. Secondly, we analyze the bias that arises because the set 
of schools that participate in financial literacy programs is not 
random. Such selection bias is estimated as the pre-program performance 
in financial PISA of students in applicant schools relative to a 
nationally representative sample of schools. We then study if estimators
 that condition on school and parental characteristics mitigate 
selection bias.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13528_abstract">The
 ideal of direct replication of previous scientific findings is widely 
applauded, but rarely carried out in empirical social science. Recently a
 "reproducibility crisis" in psychology-- including high-profile 
replication failures-- has led to extensive replication and a rapid, 
significant shift in journal publication practices. Should we be also 
concerned about replicability of lab experiments in economics? To 
provide evidence we are conducting a large-scale direct replication of 
18 experimental studies published in AER and QJE in  2011-2014. 
(Replications are hard-scheduled to be conducted in May-July 2015). Each
 study will replicated once at one of four international locations. 
Sample sizes were carefully chosen to have 90% power to detect an effect
 of the size that was originally reported. &lt;br /&gt;
Before the replications are conducted, prediction markets (PMs) will be 
conducted among self-selected traders from the Economic Science 
Association mailing list, and economics journal editorial boards. The 
PMs will produce a collective probability that results will replicate 
(according to a strict criterion). &lt;br /&gt;
The replication results will provide a novel sample of how well 
experiments replicate. The PMs will provide evidence about how easy it 
was for peers to predict what papers were replicable or not. &lt;br 
/&gt;
All results will be interesting: Many experimentalists think it is 
highly likely all results will replicate. Others may be skeptical-- as 
the PMs may show-- that some results are vulnerable. This project 
provides hard data to use in discussing possible improvements in 
scientific practice (if, indeed, any are needed). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13529_abstract">In
 many sciences there are suspicions that if a statistical threshold of 
significance is useful to make a finding publishable, scientists will 
find conscious or implicit methods to "p-hack" to reach such thresholds.
 However, if many researchers are p-hacking in this way, or journals are
 only selecting sub-threshold results to publish, then the distribution 
of published p-values will have a particular shape.  The "p-curve", the 
histogram of how frequently published results reach various p-values, 
should be bunched near .05 if there is p-hacking or publication bias. 
However, if results are genuine and not p-hacked or publication-biased, 
there will be relatively many results with low p-values (e.g. &lt;.01) 
and not so many just below the threshold. This paper introduces these 
methods, and describes their foundation and value, to economists. (Note 
that they are not only potentially useful in experiments, but also in 
all areas of empirical economics.) We then create such a p-curve for all
 papers published in the journal Experimental Economics and other 
experimental papers published in mainstream journals in 2009-2013.  The 
p-curve has many results at very low p-values and no bunching just below
 .05, indicating no detectable p-hacking or publication bias, unlike 
many results from studies of psychology experiments.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10224_abstract">I
 conduct a field experiment in nineteen rural schools in northern India 
to investigate whether the norms associated with one’s social identity 
affect one’s aspirations, beliefs, and eventual outcomes. Utilizing a 
“priming” methodology used in social psychology, and more recently in 
economics, I exploit environmental cues within the subjects’ everyday 
environment to “prime” either caste or gender identity through priming 
questionnaires, thereby introducing exogenous variation in the salience 
of one’s social identity. Randomly assigning whether a subject’s caste 
or gender (or neither) is primed, I first elicit long-run aspirations of
 adolescents (parents) for their (their child’s) future income, 
educational attainment and occupation. I find that girls have 
aspirations and beliefs that are biased downwards when gender is primed,
 while parents of high caste adolescents have higher aspirations and 
beliefs about income as well as educational attainment when caste is 
primed. Next, I set up a learning camp at school over ten weeks for 
these adolescents, in order to test whether identity affects learning 
outcomes. I elicit subjects’ aspirations and beliefs for each of the 
tests conducted at the learning camp, and record attendance and actual 
test scores over the ten weeks. Again, I find that girls’ aspirations 
and beliefs are significantly lower when gender is primed, and that 
learning outcomes are also worse, but only for upper castes girls. 
Priming caste makes males (but not females) from upper castes have 
higher aspirations and beliefs, while females from upper castes have 
worse learning outcomes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10339_abstract">In
 this paper we try to understand whether national accounts GDP per 
capita or survey mean income or consumption better proxy for true income
 per capita. We propose a data-driven method to assess the relative 
quality of GDP per capita versus survey means by comparing the evolution
 of each series to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights.
 Our main assumption, which is robust to a variety of specification 
checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights is unrelated 
to the measurement errors in either national accounts or survey means. 
We obtain estimates of weights on national accounts and survey means in 
an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very large for 
national accounts and very modest for survey means. We conclusively 
reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is greater
 than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we generally fail to 
reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is zero. 
Using the estimated optimal weights, we compute estimates of true income
 per capita and $1/day poverty rates for the developing world and its 
regions. We get poverty estimates that are substantially lower and fall 
substantially faster than those of Chen and Ravallion (2010) or of the 
survey-based poverty literature more generally. Our result is mainly 
driven by the finding that economic growth has been higher in poor 
countries than the surveys suggest. Additionally, we provide evidence 
that national accounts are good indicators of desirable outcomes for the
 poor (such as longer life expectancy, better education and access to 
safe water), and we show that surveys appear to perform worse in 
developing countries that are richer and that are growing faster.</div>

 paper investigates the impact of the 1985 Turkish Immunization 
Campaign, a nationwide campaign which vaccinated children from 0 to 60 
months against measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis on 
health and human capital. Using reconstructed data on the baseline 
prevalence of vaccine preventable illnesses by birth province, we find 
that children age-eligible for the vaccination campaign  were less 
likely to be disabled and illiterate. We find similar but smaller gains 
on human capital for middle-school age children who had an age eligible 
child in their household; furthermore, these spillover effects accrue 
only to older girl siblings. Our results are interpreted within a model 
of intrahousehold allocation in which older children of different 
genders must divide their time between childcare and schooling. The 
findings lend support to the view that girls' human capital accumulation
 is particularly sensitive to the health of younger children in the

educational attainment in the developing world.</div>

 in risk-adjusted treatment rates across hospitals serving similar 
patient populations are often interpreted as some hospitals delivering 
too much or too little care, either because they’re maximizing something
 other than health, or because they misperceive their ability to deliver

varies across providers, so that variation in treatments rates across 
providers reflects their comparative advantage at delivering

plausible, such that a correlation between value-added and lagged scores
 would suggest that value-added is biased: how can changes in current 
teacher quality affect students' past test scores? The problem with this
 placebo test is that teacher value-added is itself estimated from prior
 test scores. Hence, changes in current teacher VA will be mechanically 
correlated with changes in prior scores even when a research design is 
valid. We show that simple variants of the lagged score placebo test 
that remove this mechanical effect uncover no evidence of a relationship
 between changes in teacher VA and lagged test scores. We conclude that

 high-dimension parameter space. I use invariance arguments to develop a
 fixed-effects oracle estimator. It is not feasible, but provides a 
lower bound on risk. It suggests a feasible estimator which almost 
achieves this lower bound, over the part of the parameter space that is 
relevant in the empirical example. There is an alternative approximation

Both of these feasible approximations to the oracle estimator provide

 with salience theories of choice, we find that managers overreact to 
salient risks. We study how managers respond to the occurrence of a 
hurricane event when their firms are located in the neighborhood of the 
disaster area. We find that the sudden shock to the perceived liquidity 
risk leads managers to increase the amount of corporate cash holdings, 
even though the real liquidity risk remains unchanged. Such an increase 
in cash holdings is only temporary. Over time, the perceived risk 
decreases, and the bias disappears. This bias is costly for shareholders
 because it leads to higher retained earnings and negatively impacts 
firm value by reducing the value of cash. We examine alternative

 examine the formation and evolution of firms’ attitudes towards risk

 policies. Commonality in risk preferences inside the firm arises as 
CEOs are selected to match the risk attitudes of existing directors and 
executives, and CEOs in turn shape the composition of executive teams 
and boards to be more aligned with their own risk preferences. Selection
 also gives rise to persistence in corporate risk attitudes over time 
and across generations of leadership. But poor performance in the firm 
and economic shocks in the industry can lead firms to change their risk 
culture. Finally, corporate policies are significantly associated with 
corporate risk culture. For financial policies, i.e., cash holdings and 
financial leverage, the association largely reflects the persistent 
component of corporate risk culture, while for investment policies, in

The well-documented
increase in average cash holdings in recent decades is not unique, but in fact is similar in
magnitude and rate of change to cash dynamics that occurred nearly a century ago.
Despite similarities in the mean, the cross-section of cash holdings has evolved quite
differently in recent years relative to earlier periods. Large increases in average cash
holdings from 1920 – 1945 and large decreases from 1945 – 1970 were broad-based,
occurring at all points in the distribution of firms, among companies of all sizes, and
among both new and existing firms. In contrast, modern average cash trends are
dominated by new Nasdaq firms in the technology and healthcare sectors entering the
sample. For most of the recent sample period, within-firm changes in cash are negative or
flat.
We examine the ability of standard models of cash holdings to explain these shifts in the
nature of cash policies and find little change in the dynamics of cash management over
time, but some evidence that the determinants of cash targets have changed. Surprisingly,
relations thought to support precautionary and transaction motives for holding cash are
weaker or disappear earlier in the century, when financial frictions were arguably more
severe. Finally, we show that cash targets based solely on firm characteristics have little
ability to explain the large time-series changes in average or aggregate cash through the
century. Including macroeconomic variables such as productivity and GDP growth
improves the model’s ability to capture the time series evolution of corporate cash.</div>

 to adopt a staggered board is related to an ex ante lower firm value, 
which helps reconciling our novel results to prior cross-sectional

share of delinquencies in the crisis relative to earlier years. At the 
individual borrower level, the relation between mortgage growth and 
income remained positive throughout the boom. These results highlight 
the importance of middle class borrowers for understanding the crisis. 
They also support the view that both homebuyers and lenders bought into 
increasing house values and borrowers defaulted once prices dropped.</div>

 study the effects of the creation of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) on corporate governance. Established in 1934, the SEC 
effectively applied the listing standards of the NYSE to all regional 
stock exchanges in the U.S. We therefore examine the impact of the SEC 
by comparing non-NYSE listing firms before and after the landmark 
legislation was adopted, using the NYSE as a control group. Our 
estimates reveal that there was a 30% reduction in board independence, 
i.e., the creation of the SEC caused boards to become significantly less
 independent. We find no corresponding effects on firm valuations. Our 
evidence is consistent with a "substitution of governance mechanisms" 
hypothesis, i.e., firms endogenously trade off market-based (board) 
governance and government-sponsored (SEC) governance. This evidence has 
implications for corporate governance regulation around the world.</div>

 We show that municipalities’ credit constraints can have important 
effects on local economies through a ratings channel. We identify these 
effects by exploiting exogenous variation on U.S. municipal bond ratings
 due to Moody’s recalibration of its ratings scale in 2010. We find that
 local governments increase expenditures and employment due to an 
expansion of their debt capacity following a rating upgrade. These 
increases in local government spending have a local income multiplier of
 2.4 and a cost per job of $21,000. Our findings suggest that 
debt-financed increases in local government spending can improve

 paper expands on Brunnermeier, Gorton and Krishnamurthy (2011) and 
implements a liquidity measure, "Liquidity Mismatch Index (LMI)," to 
gauge the mismatch between the market liquidity of assets and the 
funding liquidity of liabilities. We construct the LMIs for 2882 bank 
holding companies during 2002 - 2014 and investigate the time-series and
 cross-sectional patterns of banks' liquidity  and liquidity risk. The 
aggregate banking sector liquidity worsens from +$5 trillion before the 
crisis to -$3 trillion in 2008, and reverses back to the pre-crisis 
level in 2009.  We also show how a liquidity stress test can be 
conducted with the LMI metric, and that such a stress test as an 
effective macroprudential tool could have revealed the liquidity need of
 the banking system in the late 2007. In the cross section, we find that
 banks with more liquidity mismatch have a higher crash probability in 
the financial crisis and have a higher chance to borrow from the 
government during the financial crisis.  Thus our LMI measure is 
informative regarding both individual bank liquidity risk as well as the
 liquidity risk of the entire banking system.</div>

 management failures often expose inadequate monitoring and

inefficient risk management where the time cost of such processes 
creates strategic complementarities among firms that compete for trading
 opportunities. Higher trading volume, market immediacy, and price

 for regulating risk management both as a coordination failure and as a

 paper studies fund flows and risk allocation decisions among prime 
money market funds (MMFs) during the 2011–2012 eurozone crisis. We 
exploit much more granular measures of fund credit risk and investor 
sophistication than those previously employed in the literature. 
Empirically, we find that funds
with greater credit risks experienced larger outflows during the 
eurozone crisis. This effect was substantially magnified among those 
funds held by the most sophisticated investors. A key finding in our 
study is that these sophisticated investors were quicker to redeem when 
credit risk was attributable to European investments, relative to the 
same level of credit risk attributable to other regions. In turn, we 
find that managers of riskier funds serving sophisticated investors more
 aggressively reduced their European risk exposure, while often adding 
risk exposure to other regions. Taken together, our results suggest that
 sophisticated investors closely monitor money fund portfolios and 
step-up redemptions when funds are on a riskier trajectory; in addition,
 fund managers appear to endogenize this threat by reallocating 
portfolio risks in a way that addresses redemptions. Our paper provides a
 unique perspective on this mechanism, as we study a period when, for 
the first time, investors had nearly real-time portfolio information on 
their money fund investments.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21469_abstract">It
 is well established that equity issuance for most non-financial firms 
is procyclical. This paper shows that, in contrast, equity issuance for 
banks is countercyclical across credit cycles after 1980, as is retained
 income. Thus, during credit booms, banks raise less equity, even though
 more equity might help banks better absorb shocks. This paper shows 
that government guarantees play a crucial role in driving banks' 
countercyclical equity issuance. Countercyclical equity issuance arises 
in the U.S. during the bailouts of the 1980s, mostly in banks that 
equity markets perceive as “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF). Across types of 
firms, historical time periods, and countries, equity issuance is 
countercyclical when government guarantees are strong and procyclical 
when government guarantees are weak. Furthermore, bank equity issuance 
becomes more countercyclical in Eurozone countries that gain increased 
implicit guarantees upon adopting the Euro. These findings help explain 
why banks may resist raising equity during credit expansions, making 
financial distress more likely.</div>

 hypothesize that trust plays an important role in affecting the 
activeness and effectiveness of the global mutual fund industry. 
Empirically, trust is positively associated with the activeness of 
domestic funds, whereas for internationals mutual funds conducting 
cross-border investments activeness is bounded by the trust of low-trust
 countries. In both cases, trust-related active share delivers superior 
performance, although the economic magnitude is larger for cross-border 
investments (around 2% per year). Our results suggest that trust, 
including both trust in fund managers and trust in the market of

 affiliated with large financial institutions are more likely to exit

 propose a tractable model of an informationally inefficient market. We 
show the equivalence between our model and a substantially simpler model
 whereby investors face distortive investment taxes depending both on 
their identity and the asset class. We use this equivalence to assess 
existing approaches to inferring whether individual investors have 
informational advantages. We also develop a methodology of inferring the
 magnitude of the frictions (implicit
taxes) that impede financial trade. We illustrate the methodology by 
using data on cross-country portfolio holdings and returns to quantify 
these frictions, and locate the directions in which financial trade 
seems to be especially impeded. We argue that our measure of frictions 
contains useful information for the sources of failure of frictionless 
models, and it helps in studying whether certain factors (such as the 
size of the financial sector) are associated with lower financial

 consider a noisy rational expectations equilibrium in a multi-asset 
economy populated by informed and uninformed investors, and noise

payoffs and allow for assets with very general payoff distributions,

contingent claims provide information about the source of uncertainty in

apply our results to pricing risky debt and equity and demonstrate that 
firms cannot manipulate the information contained in debt and equity 
prices by changing the face value of debt. Our paper provides a new 
tractable framework for studying asset prices under asymmetric

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20166_abstract">Information
 asymmetries and trading costs, in a financial market model with dynamic
 information, generate a self-exciting equilibrium price process with 
stochastic volatility, even if news have constant volatility.
Intuitively, new (constant volatility) information is released to the 
market at trading times that, due to traders' strategic choices, differ 
from calendar times.
This generates an endogenous stochastic time change between trading and 
calendar times, and stochastic volatility of the price process in 
calendar time. 
In equilibrium: price volatility is autocorrelated and is a non-linear 
function of number and volume of trades; the relative informativeness of
 number and volume of trades depends on the data sampling frequency; 
volatility, the limit order book, tightness, depth, resilience, and 
trading activity, are jointly determined by information asymmetries and 
trading costs.
Our closed form solutions rationalize a large set of empirical evidence 
and provide a natural laboratory for analyzing the equilibrium effects 
of a financial transaction tax.

 study the real e¢ciency implications of releasing public information in
 a model with multiple dimensions of uncertainty where market prices 
convey information to real decision makers. Disclosing more precise 
public information has a positive direct e¤ect of providing new 
information and an indirect e¤ect of changing price informativeness. The
 direction of the indirect e¤ect depends on the type of information 
being disclosed. Paradoxically, when disclosure is about a variable that
 real decision makers care to learn, the indirect e¤ect is negative and 
attenuates the direct e¤ect. Moreover, in markets which are very 
e¤ective in aggregating private information, the negative indirect e¤ect
 can be stronger than the direct e¤ect, implying that better disclosure 
can reduce the overall quality of information available to decision 
makers and harm real e¢ciency.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20273_abstract">We
 investigate how distraction affects the trading behavior of 
professional asset managers. Exploring detailed transaction-level data, 
we show that managers with a large fraction of portfolio stocks 
exhibiting an earnings announcement are significantly less likely to 
trade in other stocks, suggesting that these announcements absorb 
attention which is missing for the choice of which stocks to trade. 
Hence, attention constraints can be binding even among this elite group 
of traders. Finally, we investigate the impact of distraction on trade 
performance and find tentative, albeit weak, evidence that distraction 
hurts managers’ trade execution quality and stock-picking ability.</div>

 the last 35 years, the concentration of institutional assets in equity 
markets has increased dramatically. The stock ownership by the largest 
ten asset managers now accounts for 23.1% of total stock market 
capitalization, having quadrupled over this period. The paper asks 
whether idiosyncratic shocks to these institutions can spill over to 
their underlying holdings through their trading activity. The conjecture
 is that large institutions are granular, that is, they cannot be 
reduced to a diversified collection of smaller entities. We provide 
evidence of a causal effect of ownership by large institutions on the 
volatility of their stock holdings. Moreover, we show that these effects
 are driven by larger-than-expected trades as well as by concentrated 
investor flows. Finally, the stocks owned by large institutions exhibit 
stronger price inefficiency.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20983_abstract">The
 paper studies empirically the reaction of informed investors to the 
presence of short sellers in the market. We find that other investors 
trade more slowly when short sellers are active. In addition, they break
 down their orders across a larger number of brokers. Consequently, they
 end up paying higher commissions and turn to more unfamiliar brokers. 
These effects are stronger when information asymmetry is more severe. 
Finally, when investors decrease their trading speed, prices adjust more
 slowly to a given amount of short selling. These findings are 
consistent with theories that predict a slow-down in trading activity by
 investors seeking to protect their informational advantage. A possible 
implication of our findings is that short selling does not always 
improve price efficiency, especially when information asymmetry is more 
severe.</div>

 document a novel channel through which coordinated noise trading exerts
 externalities on financial markets dominated by institutional 
investors. We exploit a unique set of events where Chilean pension fund 
investors followed an influential financial advisory firm that 
recommended frequent reallocations between equity and bond funds. The 
recommendations, which mostly followed short-term return trends, 
generated large and coordinated fund flows. Since the advisory firm 
gained popularity through social media, young investors were more likely
 to follow the recommendations and to reallocate their retirement 
savings. The fund flows resulted in substantial price pressure and 
increased volatility in both the equity and bond markets. Pension funds 
reduced their holdings of illiquid securities and increased cash 
holdings as a response to these flows. Our findings suggest that giving 
retirement savers unconstrained reallocation opportunities may 
destabilize financial markets and impose social costs on market 
participants.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21941_abstract">A
 majority of elderly households in the U.S. hold over half their wealth 
in the form of housing ownership. For this reason, the recent boom/bust 
cycle in the housing market has fueled interest in examining the labor 
market reactions of elderly households, as they experienced the 
financial crisis and traditional retirement planning periods 
concurrently. Using the restricted access version of the Health and 
Retirement Study covering the last two decades, we investigate how 
housing wealth, property taxes and financial wealth influence retirement
 and unretirement. We also use respondents’ self-reported probability of
 continuing work past age 62 to examine early retirement expectations, 
along with actual reporting of retirement timing, exploring interesting 
differences between them. Our investigation produces three main 
findings: (1) both retirement and unretirement transitions are 
influenced by housing wealth and property taxes in the expected opposing
 directions; (2) financial wealth shocks, together with changes in 
health, explain longitudinal variation in retirement expectations prior 
to the actual retirement; (3) unexpected changes in retirement decisions
 are influenced by housing wealth shocks and property taxes, but not 
financial wealth. Our findings offer important implications for 
evaluating the consequences of the recent housing bubble on older 
households in the U.S. and for designing retirement-related policies.</div>

 of the state of housing affordability generated under the prevailing 
methods potentially exhibit a bias caused by households’ sub- and 
supra-standard consumption of housing. Instead, we propose and implement
 a method for estimating effective housing affordability based on 
standardized housing consumption. We employ an extensive dataset on 
Israeli households over the period 1992-2012. Results indicate a 
continuous under-assessment of the state of housing unaffordability and 
affordability inequality in the absence of consumption standardization. 
Further, the association between housing affordability and household 
socio-demographic characteristics is under-evaluated. Results also 
provide evidence for a continuously increasing level of inequality in 
the consumption of housing over the past two decades. Our evidence may 
serve policy-makers in designing programs aimed to mitigate housing 
distress.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13799_abstract">The
 ability of communities to realize Pareto efficient outcomes may 
potentially be realized through the practice of fiscal zoning. A common 
concern to this theory is the prospect that political boundaries may 
undermine this process. If nuisance entities produce negative 
externalities that decay over distance and host fee compensation is 
completely internalized, then host fee compensation need not reflect the
 full external damages if the nuisance is sited along a political 
border. Furthermore, if a nuisance entity can credibly commit to being 
sited on either side of the border, host fee compensation can fall to 
zero. This paper presents a simple theoretical model that helpfully 
describes a, empirical strategy for testing the political boundary 
hypothesis among local governments. The strategy is applied to wind 
turbines in the continental United States across 1,258 local 
governments. The results are not supportive of the concerns and actually
 indicate that land near political boundaries is less likely to be used 
for nuisance siting.</div>

Existence of wells within 3,500 feet of a property reduces property 
values by approximately 3%.</div>

 relationship between neighborhood physical environment and social 
disorder, particularly crime, is of critical interest to urban 
economists and sociologists, as well as local governments.  Over the 
past 50 years, various policy interventions to improve physical 
conditions in distressed neighborhoods have also been heralded for their
 potential to reduce crime.  Urban renewal programs in the mid-20th 
century and public housing redevelopment in the 1990s both subscribed to
 the idea that signs of physical disorder invite social disorder.  More 
recently, the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provided 
funding for local policymakers to rehabilitate or demolish foreclosed 
and vacant properties, in order to mitigate negative 
spillovers—including crime—on surrounding neighborhoods.  In this paper,
 we investigate the impact of NSP investments on localized crime 
patterns in Cleveland, Chicago and Denver. Results suggest that 
demolition activity in Cleveland decreased burglary and theft, but do 
not find measurable impacts of property rehabilitation 
investments—although the precision of these estimates are limited by the
 number of rehabilitation activities. </div>

 can care work be financed and sustained in capitalist industrialized 
economies? In light of the current crisis of reproduction with e.g. 
global care chains and the overexploitation of natural resources, this 
question challenges actual ways of organizing care. At the nexus of the 
analysis of care and sustainability economics, the paper answers the 
question by discussing Tove Soilands proposal of a “Care Tax based on 
the hypothesis of diverging productivities. By this analysis it could be
 found that care is externalized by the capitalist market system and 
affected by the feminist-marxist coined term of Landnahme. This is also 
true for the natural environment which causes a twofold trouble in 
creating sustainable economies. A solution for correcting these 
externalizations could be a care tax internalizing problematic 
externalities, designed in analogy to the German “Ecological Tax 
Reform”. Three variations of this so constructed care tax are developed 
in the paper. Finally the paper seeks to identify economic instruments 
for an economics drawing on findings of feminist economics and 
sustainability sciences.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13742_abstract">This
 study explores the effects of globalization on fertility rates of 
countries. Globalization affects the income gap among certain groups and
 the  gender gap is not an exception. Since a couple consisting of a man
 and a woman is one decision unit of family planning, there is a growing
 consensus that the gender gap influences the population of countries. 
In this study, we find that globalization (in terms of integration of 
capital market) alters the gender gap in wage rates through the changes 
in labor demand for capital-intensive sectors. Consequently, 
globalization leads to opposite effects on fertility decisions in 
capital-importing and capital-exporting countries, via changes in the 
bargaining positions of men and women. Moreover, by taking account of 
the properties of industrial structures of capital-importing and 
capital-exporting countries, our results show that globalization induces
 empirically observed declines in fertility rates throughout the world. 
We finally argue that both promoting globalization and keeping women’s 
autonomy are achieved at the same time if women are allowed to control 
their labor supply as the determinant of their autonomy within the 
marriage.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14281_abstract">In
 this paper, I investigate determinants of growth in the financial asset
 holdings of nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) in the post-1970 US 
economy. I first develop a framework that describes firm-level portfolio
 and financing decisions by a balance sheet adjustment process. This 
framework emphasizes interdependence between NFC decisions to invest in 
fixed capital or acquire financial assets, and to borrow. Applying the 
framework to a firm-level panel of US corporations, I find empirical 
evidence that shareholder value-maximizing objectives of NFC managers 
are one important determinant of growth in NFC financial asset holdings.
 This relationship strengthens for later time periods – as institutions 
supporting shareholder value orientation become increasingly entrenched –
 and for sub-samples of larger firms. Shareholder value orientation is, 
furthermore, found to be a stronger predictor of growth in cash than in 
total financial asse! ts. This cash finding is important given that 
shareholder value orientation is aimed, in part, at encouraging managers
 to ‘disgorge’ excess cash. Finally, NFC financial asset holdings are 
also positively related to firm-level volatility, suggesting that – in a
 context of rising firm-level volatility – firms’ precautionary motive 
for holding liquid assets has strengthened over this period.</div>

This article argues that the financial liberalization of the last 
decades that resulted in a worldwide crisis relied on an institutional 
change which ill-shaped actors’ behavior so as to let them enter into 
unsustainable speculative activities at the expense of macro stability. 
To support such an assertion the article draws upon a specific 
Veblen-Minsky approach to a credit-money economy and its endogenous 
fragilities. It maintains that when financial markets are liberalized 
and private-interests-related self-regulation replaces public 
macro-prudential supervision, the financial system undergoes 
institutional deadlock and the ensuing confusion is transformed into a 
market gridlock. Markets then become unable to recover without public 
rescue operations of banks. The subsequent negative economic and social 
consequences are beyond the limits of any acceptable liberal ideology 
and scientific understanding. Therefore systemic stability calls for a 
tighter macro-regulatory framework to remove the domination of 
speculative finance over economic decisions and activities.

 paper relates cultural distance (CD), as a further attribute of 
transactions, and governance structures. We suggest an additional 
problem of economic organization: assessing alternative governance 
structures in terms of the socialization dynamics they enable, which 
entail different intraorganizational transaction costs due to CD. We 
assume that transactions in organizations can be assigned to and 
organized within governance structures that allow transaction cost 
economizing socialization processes. Our socialization governance 
approach appeals to behavioral theory and cultural evolution. A model of
 cultural evolution captures socialization processes and the development
 of CD within and between groups or organizational units. It describes 
the idiosyncratic learning and socialization dynamics taking place in 
groups of interacting agents and explains important aspects of 
governance structures and related transaction costs. CD has be! en used 
as a key variable in many areas of organizational behavior and firms 
have been interpreted as multi-cultural teams. We suggest that given 
certain socialization dynamics that occur in groups and that are based 
on evolved human cognitive dispositions, processes of convergence and 
divergence in CD within and between organizational units take place. 
Furthermore, CD between parties is an important attribute of 
transactions. Transaction cost theorists associate higher CD with higher
 costs of transaction due to communication costs or less efficient 
intraorganisational transfer of knowledge and skills. Employees who have
 different cultures impose costs on an organization that would be absent
 were cultures homogeneous. An organization can react to this challenge 
by choosing suited governance structures that close CD between 
individuals or organizational entities.</div>

 paper applies Edgar Schein’s model of organizational culture to 
financial firms and their prudential regulators. It identifies a series 
of hard-to-change cultural norms and assumptions that create powerful 
incentive conflicts for regulators in any country when large,complex, 
and politically powerful banks fall into distress. Throughout the 
business cycle, these unspoken norms favor light-touch supervision and 
misrepresentations that support reckless go-for-broke risk-taking by a 
country's major banks. The author argues that this behavior meets the 
every-day definition of theft. To have a chance of working, financial 
reform must identify and attack these norms so as to sanction individual
 decision-makers for the harm their abusive risk-taking visits on other 
citizens. Current reforms seek only to constrain the pursuit of tail 
risk and focus on collecting large fines from shareholders when managers
 can be shown to have viola! ted capital, liquidity, or market-conduct 
restrictions. But to reduce individual managers' incentives to pursue 
tail risk, it is necessary to re-characterize willful risk-shifting as 
theft and to outlaw it directly by re-writing corporate law to establish
 that managers of megabanks owe fiduciary duties of loyalty, competence,
 and care to taxpayers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14285_abstract">Social
 banks (SBs) claim that their values and practices distinguish 
themselves from traditional banks insofar as they prioritise social 
goals over financial ones. The main goal of SBs consists in serving 
community-oriented projects and social enterprises, which put the 
emphasis not only on financial returns, but also –and often as a 
priority– on social aims. Our study examines how these “virtuous” 
principles are evident from the observed behaviour of social banks. Our 
investigation relies on a rich European dataset consisting of 6,500 
European banks, and our observation window covers the 1999-2013 period. 
Of this large group of banks, we identify around 30 banks as SBs. We 
aggregate micro-level bank balance sheet data (at unconsolidated level) 
from Bankscope, which is a standard source for institutional comparisons
 of banks. Our preliminary results shows that, as compared to 
profit-maximizing banks, SBs promote to a greater extent stakeholder 
value and contribute more to financial stability (via higher z-score). 
Second, SBs adhere more to uncomplicated financial intermediation 
principles than their counterparts, in particular when we look at the 
non-interest income share in gross revenue. However, there is also 
evidence on SBs having excess liquidity. Third, there is evidence 
suggesting that SBs exhibit sounder loan portfolios than their 
counterparts. Interestingly, stakeholder banks generally occupy an 
intermediate position between SBs and commercial banks in our results. 
Finally, asset growth rates prove to be significantly higher for SBs, in
 particular since the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis.</div>

 paper tries to answer the following question. If Cuba’s workforce is 
stagnant, if the country’s investment to GDP ratio is one of the lowest 
in the world, and if total factor productivity growth has been 
miserable, why has the Cuban economy expanded so rapidly since the 
country emerged from its post-Soviet doldrums? The main answer is that 
in 1994, at the end of the post-Soviet contraction, the country still 
had considerable unused resources and that, over the following 18-year 
period, it has been using these resources with ever greater intensity. 
Another, probably smaller, part of the answer is that numbers in the 
social services sector occasionally have been cooked to show higher than
 actual growth.</div>

 study the effects of two randomized educational interventions on 
competition choices in a large set of elementary school children. The 
first intervention emphasizes the role of effort in success and the 
importance of grit and perseverance. The second intervention is based on
 exposing a randomly selected subset of children to successful female 
role models in male-dominated occupations. We then experimentally 
measure the impact of these interventions on: (1) initial competition 
choice in a real-effort task, (2) the response to performance feedback, 
i.e. the choice to compete again or quit after failure. We also examine 
the  self-confidence levels and occupational aspirations of children. 
Our results suggest that changing the beliefs about the role of effort 
significantly reduces the gender gap in competitiveness, through its 
influence on the response to feedback.</div>

 affects everything from fertility and labor force participation to 
health. But why are some societies more religious than others? To answer
 this question, I test the religious coping theory, which states that 
many individuals draw on their religious beliefs to understand and deal 
with adverse life events. Combining sub-national district level data on 
values across the globe from the World Values Survey with spatial data 
on natural disasters, I find that individuals are more religious when 
their district was hit recently by an earthquake. And further, that 
individuals are more religious when living in areas with higher long 
term earthquake risk. Using data on children of immigrants in Europe, I 
document that this is mainly due to a long-term effect: high religiosity
 levels, evolving in high earthquake risk areas, are passed on through 
generations to individuals no longer living in high earthquake risk 
areas. The impact is global: earthquakes increase religiosity both 
within Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, and within all continents. 
Last, I document that the results are consistent with the literature on 
religious coping and inconsistent with alternative theories of insurance
 or selection.</div>

 propose and test a model where religious provision of social insurance 
explains why fiscal and social conservatism align in the times and 
places that they do. We find evidence that religious groups with greater
 within-group charitable giving are more against the welfare state and 
more socially conservative. The alignment disappears when there is a 
state church and it reverses for members of a state church (social 
conservatives become fiscal liberals). Increases in church-state 
separation precede increases in the alignment between fiscal and social 
conservatism. This framework provides a novel explanation for religious 
history: as credit markets develop, elites gain access to alternative 
social insurance. They increase church-state separation to create a 
constituency for lower taxes. This holds if religious voters exceed 
non-religious voters, otherwise, elites prefer less church-state 
separation in order to curb the secular left. This generates multiple 
steady states where some countries sustain high church-state separation,
 high religiosity, and a low welfare state, and vice versa. We use this 
framework to help explain the changing nature of religious movements, 
from the Social Gospel to the religious right and why church-state 
separation arose in the U.S. but not in many European countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14389_abstract">Catch
 shares appear to lower fishing costs by eliminating redundant capacity.
 Theory suggests that catch shares may also increase fishing revenue by 
enabling improved market timing, changes in the mix across fresh and 
frozen products, and/or changes in quality. Anecdotally, ex-vessel price
 increases have been documented for a number of catch share fisheries, 
including the noteworthy Pacific halibut case. Do ex-vessel prices 
consistently increase when new catch shares are formed? If so, can these
 price changes be tied causally to the formation of the catch share? 
Despite compelling theory and anecdotal evidence, there is little 
systematic support for the hypothesis that catch shares increase 
ex-vessel prices. We test this hypothesis using a treatment effects 
approach for all U.S. catch share fisheries. We use 
difference-in-differences to identify ex-vessel price treatment effects,
 comparing catch share treated fisheries to individually matched control
 fisheries. We contribute to the nascent but growing literature on 
evidence-based fishery policy evaluation. Examples of our results from 
the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico include: a 30% ex-vessel price 
premium for wreckfish, a 15% premium for red snapper, premiums of 
roughly 15% for tilefish but that are not statistically significant, and
 negative premiums for shallow water grouper, deep water grouper, gag, 
and red grouper that are sometimes statistically significant. In sharp 
contrast, our preliminary results for Alaskan halibut (using U.S. 
Pacific Northwest as a control) suggest a statistically significant 60% 
premium for halibut under ITQs (much larger than any of our South 
Atlantic and Gulf examples). We discuss implications for the 
reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act.</div>

 study the timing-of-extraction problem facing a decentralized mine 
owner when extraction entails environmental damage. When the 
environmental damage from mining is known, the optimal timing will 
depend on the magnitude of the damage relative to these costs in the 
rest of the world. But when environmental damage is uncertain, and these
 costs are revealed over time, a quasi-option value arises. We show that
 for sufficiently high uncertainty over this damage, it is socially 
optimal to postpone the mining decision, even when the expected value of
 damages would otherwise suggest it is optimal to mine immediately. We 
show conditions under which it is optimal to postpone the mining 
decision indefinitely, and conditions when it is optimal to postpone 
only for a finite duration. The analysis leverages a crucial observation
 that distinguishes the non-renewable resource problem from the 
traditional quasi-option value framework. In the traditional framework, 
the presence of an irreversible investment and uncertainty can help 
nudge the decision maker to preserve the option, but it by no means 
implies the decision maker should always preserve the option. In 
contrast, for a non-renewable resource model, the logic of the Hotelling
 rule suggests that in the absence of uncertainty, the marginal mine 
owner is completely indifferent between mining immediately and at any 
point in the future. Thus, for our problem, any uncertainty will 
convince him to defer the mining decision.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14391_abstract">A
 common forest protection strategy used in countries where legal 
enforcement of deforestation laws is weak aims to increase agricultural 
productivity and intensification, in order to reduce the pressure to 
clear forests for new land. We show that such productivity-enhancing 
strategies can have ambiguous effects on forest protection in theory: it
 can expand the scope of farming, which is detrimental to the forest, 
but it can also induce farmers facing factor-market constraints to 
switch away from environmentally destructive cattle grazing and into 
less-harmful crop cultivation. We examine these predictions using five 
waves of the Brazil Agricultural census, and by re-constructing the 
evolution of the electricity grid for Brazil for the period 1960-2000. 
We show that electrification increased crop productivity (partly through
 irrigation investments), and farmers’ land use decisions subsequently 
change. The productivity increase leads to farming expansion and 
frontier land conversion, but also shifts land use within farms away 
from land-intensive cattle ranching and into crop cultivation. The 
latter allows farmers to retain more native vegetation within rural 
settlements, and overall we estimate that electrification causes a net 
decrease in deforestation in Brazil. We address the endogeneity of 
infrastructure placement by developing a model that forecasts hydropower
 dam placement based on topographic attributes of each location, and 
produces hypothetical maps that show how the electrical grid would have 
evolved had infrastructure allocation been based solely on exogenous 
cost considerations. The maps isolate the exogenous portion of the panel
 variation in electrification, and we use them to instrument for the 
evolution of the actual electricity grid, while controlling for location
 fixed effects.</div>

 study both theoretically and empirically how the presence of a 
substitute alters the exploitation path of an open access resource. 
Elephants, poached for ivory, are the endangered species, and mammoth 
ivory is a non-renewable substitute.  Our theory shows that the presence
 of the mammoth ivory substitute reduces both the elephant poaching rate
 and the minimum viable elephant population. Thus, there exist elephant 
population levels which are non-viable absent a substitute, but become 
viable with a substitute.  Our empirical analysis finds that absent the 
eighty tonnes of Russian mammoth ivory exports per annum 2010-2012, the 
current poaching level of 34,000 elephants per year may have increased 
to as many as 85,000 elephants per year, out of a population of a 
half-million animals, and reduced elephant ivory prices by $100 per 
kilogram.  Thus mammoth ivory trade may be saving elephants from 
extinction. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14299_abstract">We
 use a comprehensive new data in China with 28000 households to 
understand the role of informal finance for household consumption. 
Informal loans are quantitatively important for Chinese households both 
in terms of incidence and loan amounts. Reliance on informal loans is 
stronger for rural residents, younger households, low-income residents, 
less-educated households, households with more children and more working
 adults. While affiliation with the Communist Party does not affect 
usage of informal finance, the number of siblings of the household 
couple does. Furthermore, access to informal loans is robustly and 
positively related to average consumption per household member. The 
effects are especially pronounced when dealing with the endogeneity of 
access to informal finance by using the instrumental variable of the 
number of siblings of the household couple. Informal finance is also 
especially helpful for the poor. The effect differs by types of 
consumption. The daily consumption of rural households is not affected 
by informal financing, while their long-term consumption is 
substantially boosted by it. In contrast, urban households, upon access 
to informal finance, seem to feature a tradeoff between daily 
consumption and long-term consumption: they reduce daily consumption 
while increase their long-term consumption.</div>

 paper examines the impact of family size on household saving. We first 
study a theoretical life-cycle model that includes finite lifetimes, 
saving for retirement, and in which parents care about the consumption 
of their dependent children. The model implies a negative relationship 
between the number of dependent children in the family and a household’s
 saving rate. Then, we test the model’s implications using a new data 
set on household finances in China. We use the differential enforcement 
of the one-child policy across counties to address the endogeneity 
between household saving and fertility decisions within a standard 
two-stage least squares Tobit regression. We find that Chinese families 
with fewer dependent children have significantly higher saving rates. 
The regressions also indicate that saving rates vary with age and tend 
to be higher for households with more workers, higher education, better 
health, and more assets.</div>

 consider equilibrium bidding behavior in a dynamic second price auction
 where agents have the option to increase bids at random times and 
values follow a Markov process. We prove that equilibrium exists and is 
unique and give an algorithm to solve for bids as a function of time and
 values. Equilibrium bids equal the expected final value conditional on 
the bid placed being the final one, meaning that either the agent 
doesn't get another opportunity to rebid or chooses not to increase this
 bid if given the option. This results in adverse selection with respect
 to a bidder's own future strategy, and as a result bids are shaded 
relative to the bidder's expected value. This is true in spite of values
 being independent across bidders. Under mild conditions, desired bids 
increase as time increases and the close of the auction is approached. 
Our results are consistent with repeated bidding and sniping, two 
puzzling observations in eBay auctions. We estimate the model by 
matching moments from Ebay auctions and consider a series of 
counterfactuals.</div>

some of the bidders who are presented with historical winning bids

winning bids are not representative of all bids. In the steady state, 
this bias results in higher bids and auction revenue in comparison to 
the case when all bids are presented. Our experimental test confirms the

monopolist sells several goods simultaneously to a buyer with additive 
valuation.  The seller does not have a Bayesian prior over the buyer's 
values for the goods.  Instead, she knows the marginal distribution of 
values for each good separately, but not the joint distribution.  Any 
mechanism for selling the goods is evaluated by its worst-case expected

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21820_abstract">Looking
 at manufacturing industries over time and across countries, the number 
of firms and establishments is closely tied to employment. Relative to 
employment, the number of businesses is at best weakly increasing in 
output per worker. In many models of firm dynamics, trade and growth, 
these facts imply that the cost of creating a new firm or plant 
increases sharply with productivity. This increase in entry costs can 
stem from rising cost of labor used in entry, as well as higher output 
costs of setting up a business to use more sophisticated technologies. 
How entry costs vary with development matters for welfare in many 
settings, such as in love of variety models and in span-of-control 
models. Our findings suggest that the welfare impact of 
productivity-enhancing policies is not significantly amplified through 
an increase in the number of firms or plants.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21821_abstract">Firm
 dynamics in poor countries show striking differences to those of rich 
countries. While some firms indeed experience growth as they age, many 
firms are simply stagnant in that they neither exit nor expand. We 
interpret this fact as a lack of selection, whereby producers with 
little growth potential survive because innovating firms do not expand 
enough to force them out of the market. To explain these differences we 
develop a theory, whereby contractual frictions limit firms' acquisition
 of managerial time. If managerial effort provision is non-contractible,
 entrepreneurs will benefit little from delegating decision power to 
outside managers, as they spend most of their time monitoring their 
managerial personnel. As the return to managerial time is higher in big 
firms, improvements in the degree of contract enforcement will raise the
 returns of growing large and thereby increase the degree of creative 
destruction. To discipline the quantitative importance of this 
mechanism, we incorporate such incomplete managerial contracts into an 
endogenous growth model and calibrate it to firm level data from India. 
Improvements in the efficacy of managerial delegation can explain a 
sizable fraction of the difference between plants' life-cycle in the US 
and India.</div>

considerable heterogeneity in R&amp;D investments, R&amp;D participation

from enticing new firms to start R&amp;D. We find that activist policies
 increase R&amp;D substantially, but have essentially no effect on

 document that even though the normal distribution is a good

underpredicts the frequency of large economic downturns. We then provide
 a model that can explain these facts simultaneously. Our model shows 
that the propagation of microeconomic shocks through input-output 
linkages can fundamentally reshape the distribution of aggregate output,
 increasing the likelihood of large downturns (macroeconomic tail risks)
 from infinitesimal to substantial. For example, an economy subject to 
thin-tailed micro shocks but with “unbalanced” input-output linkages 
(where some sectors or firms play a much more important role than others
 as inputs suppliers to the rest of the economy) may exhibit deep 
recessions as frequently as economies that are subject to heavy-tailed 
shocks. This is despite the fact that a central limit theorem-type 
result would imply that aggregate output is normally distributed. We 
characterize what types of input-output linkages and distributions of

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21692_abstract">This
 paper studies a systematic link between the choice of export 
destinations and technology differences across firms. Our setting is 
based on three premises: (i) firms differ in the efficiency with which 
they can utilize skilled labor, (ii) product quality is higher when more
 skilled workers are used, and (iii) high-income countries value quality
 more. Thus, firms that are more efficient in the use of skilled labor 
will tend to export to high-income destinations. The contribution of the
 paper is twofold. First, we propose a new production function 
estimation method in which the production technology is heterogeneous 
across firms and we show that the parameters of the production function 
are non-parametrically identified. The identification strategy is based 
on an extension of the structural control variable approach (Olley and 
Pakes (1996); Levinsohn and Petrin (2003)) to multi-dimensional 
heterogeneous parameters. We propose sample-counterpart consistent 
estimators of firm-specific coefficients. Second, we provide an 
empirical measure of “capability” of quality production and show that it
 is a determinant of the choice of exports, export destinations, and 
quality using firm-level data from Chile.</div>

 this paper we show how to empirically study production functions that 
allow for general forms of technical differences among firms. Unlike the
 vast majority of empirical work that assumes technical differences 
among firms in an industry takes a Hicks neutral form, we allow for the 
scalar productivity of a firm to enter technology in a non-separable 
fashion. This encompasses a variety of alternative models of 
productivity, such as labor or capital augmenting technical change.  We 
show how the micro econometric production function with a general 
productivity index index can be identified and estimated using the 
information in the firm’s first order condition for a static input. 
Unlike index number approaches to productivity that also employ a 
nonparametric specification of the production function and non separable
 productivity, our approach allows for the possibility of some inputs 
being quasi-fixed (most notably capital) as well as the presence of 
ex-post productivity shocks. We use our empirical strategy to study 
industry misallocation, which has been quantified typically with 
Cobb-Douglas and Hicks neutral technical differences.</div>

 with familiarity bias tilt their portfolios towards a few risky assets 
creating two kinds of inefficiencies: underdiversification and 
underinvestment in risky assets. To understand their implications for 
growth and social welfare, we solve in closed form a model of a 
stochastic, dynamic, general-equilibrium economy with a large number of 
firms and households, who bias their investment toward a few familiar 
assets. Consistent with the existing literature, we find that the loss 
from holding a biased, and hence, underdiversified portfolio is modest. 
However, this loss is amplified because it increases household 
consumption-growth volatility. Moreover, these effects at the 
individual-household level are magnified further in general equilibrium 
through their effects on aggregate investment and growth. Our model 
demonstrates that even if we force the biases in portfolios to cancel 
out across households, the implications of familiarity bias for 
consumption and investment choices do not cancel---individual behavioral
 biases can have significant aggregate effects. Our results imply that 
financial markets are not a mere sideshow to the real economy and that 
financial literacy, regulation, and innovation that improve the 
portfolio choices of households can have a significant positive impact 
on social welfare.</div>

market variables are the first-order effect in driving both of the aggregate time series and the
cross sectional variations of credit risk. Recent studies have highlighted a link between credit
risk and macroeconomic/firm-level variables such as investment growth, financial leverage,
volatility, etc. We show that labor market variables (wage growth or labor share) can forecast
the aggregate credit spread as well as or better than alternative predictors. Furthermore,
firm-level labor expense growth rates and labor share can explain a substantial fraction
of cross sectional variations of changes in Moody-KMV expected default frequency (EDF)
across a wide range of countries. A model with wage rigidity can explain these links as well
as produce large credit spreads despite realistically low default probabilities (credit spread
puzzle). This is because pre-committed payments to labor make other committed payments
(such as debt) more risky; for this reason variables related to pre-committed labor payments
have explanatory for credit risk.</div>

 biggest empirical challenge to quantifying cross-border air pollution 
externalities is the fact that the observed pollution at a given 
locality cannot be easily decomposed and traced back to its originating 
sources when multiple countries are emitting. We propose a novel 
strategy based on the incidence of Asian Dust across South Korea -- a 
meteorological phenomenon driven by strong stable westerly wind that 
carries China’s pollution to South Korea -- to identify air pollution 
spillovers. We construct monthly and daily datasets on cause-specific 
mortalities and exploit the variation in the incidence of Asian Dust 
across 232 districts in South Korea between 2000 and 2011 as well as 
variations in China’s pollution. We find that the adverse health impacts
 of Asian Dust in South Korea get significantly amplified by China’s 
pollution, particularly on deaths from respiratory and heart diseases. 
The results are robust to various placebo tests. We compare the 
spillover impact of China’s pollution via Asian Dust with that of local 
energy production. In addition, we compare the impact of dust as a

 in the U.S. (and elsewhere) prescribe too many antibiotics. Up to half 
of all antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. are inappropriate, according
 to estimates of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
The consequences of antibiotic overprescribing are grave: besides the 
waste of resources and the risk for adverse drug reactions, overuse of 
antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance has 
been recognized to be one of the world’s most pressing public health 
problems which many developed countries face today. At least two million
 people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the U.S. 
every year, and more than 23,000 die as a direct consequence from these 
infections (CDC 2013). According to the CDC, the best way to control 
antibiotic resistance is to decrease the inappropriate use of 
antibiotics. To achieve this goal, one must first identify the factors 
that lead to inappropriate prescriptions, which are still largely 
misunderstood. This paper is the first to examine the relationship 
between malpractice pressure and actual antibiotic prescriptions. Using a
 simple theoretical model of physician prescribing behavior, I link the 
effect that a tort reform has on the number of antibiotics prescribed 
and on the effort exerted by the physician with the clinical 
appropriateness of these prescriptions. The model can be used to test 
for whether liability-induced antibiotic prescriptions indeed constitute
 a form of defensive medicine. Using 20 years of data from the National 
Ambulatory Care Survey (NAMCS), a nationally representative sample of 
visits to office-based physicians in the U.S., I estimate the causal 
effect of malpractice pressure on antibiotic prescription rates with a 
generalized differences-in-differences model that exploits the variation
 in tort law reforms across U.S. states. I allow for heterogenous 
responses to the malpractice environment across doctors and patients. 
Throughout the analysis, I carefully consider the possibility of 
legislative endogeneity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21815_abstract">As
 in many medical treatments, decision-making dynamics are central to In 
Vitro Fertilization (IVF), a technologically advanced infertility 
treatment for which patients usually pay out-of-pocket. Patients make 
decisions throughout a single treatment cycle as information about 
treatment progress is gradually revealed, and they consider the 
possibility of multiple cycles over time. Patients who choose more 
aggressive treatment actions reduce the risk of concluding a treatment 
without a birth, but this comes with an increased likelihood of a 
high-risk twin or triplet pregnancy. Several policy interventions are 
possible to increase IVF access or encourage patients to take more 
conservative treatment courses. We use data on treatment choices and 
outcomes at a single large IVF clinic to estimate technological 
processes and patient preferences in a dynamic structural model of 
patients choices within and across IVF treatments. The estimated model 
allows us to evaluate the impact of counterfactual policies to directly 
limit aggressive treatment, extend insurance to all potential patients, 
and implement new treatment processes that were unavailable in the 
market during our sample period. We also explore an alternative 
("top-up") insurance design that forces the patient to internalize the 
additional expected medical costs associated with more aggressive 
treatment options. All policies have significant impacts at the 
extensive margin and within treatment, and vary substantially in their 
impacts on patient welfare and implementation costs.</div>

 of the frequency response market in the UK allowed electricity firms to
 compete on price in an otherwise stable environment. We provide an 
analysis of the evolution of the deregulated market from the date it 
started. Initial activity was volatile, with some firms exploring 
different prices, while others made few price changes. This was followed
 by a period in which prices fell and the variance in the cross 
sectional distribution of bids declined markedly. By the end of our 
study price changes had become relatively rare and small, consistent 
with convergence to a static Nash equilibrium. We examine how well 
models of learning do in predicting play during the period prior to 
convergence but after the initial volatility. Models where perceptions 
of competitors’ play depend on past play suggest that firms’ weight 
recent play disproportionately. We also find evidence of statistical 
learning about the underlying demand parameters conditional on 
competitors’ play. A model that combines these two features fits quite 
well: it is able to explain 37% of the share-weighted variation in 
prices, even though none of the model parameters are chosen to fit the 
pricing behavior.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14224_abstract">From
 finance to automobile, many industries are mandated to disclose their 
business practice or product quality to the public. Such regulations 
often specify the areas subject to disclosure, but let businesses decide
 how to present the information. One important degree of freedom that 
businesses have is the ability to make information more or less complex.
 In other words, businesses choose how many hoops to make customers jump
 through before they can figure out important details. We explore this 
strategic complexity through a series of disclosure experiments. In a 
game with senders and receivers of a payoff-relevant piece of 
information, we require senders to truthfully disclose the information –
 but allow them to vary the complexity of the message without changing 
its information content. We present three main findings. First, senders 
with unfavorable information choose to make their disclosure more 
complex. Second, receivers make mistakes, presumably due to the 
cognitive costs of information processing. Third, receivers 
systematically underestimate the extent to which complexity is a 
strategic decision being made by senders with unfavorable information. 
Based on these findings, we explore a number of market and regulatory 
settings that may reduce complexity or help receivers fully understand 
strategic complexity.</div>

previous models that feature trade and commuting. The model allows us to
 determine economic activity, labor allocations, commuting and trade 
patterns for any geography of trade and commuting costs. The model 
allows for a sharp characterization of the equilibrium properties such

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13734_abstract">Gravity
 equations have been used for more than 50 years to estimate ex post the
 partial effects of trade costs on international trade flows, and the 
well-known -- and traditionally presumed exogenous -- ``trade-cost 
elasticity'' plays a central role in computing general equilibrium 
trade-flow and welfare effects of trade-cost changes. This paper 
addresses theoretically and empirically the influence of variable and 
fixed export costs in explaining the likely endogenous trade-cost 
elasticity. We offer four potential contributions. First, using a random
 coefficients econometric approach, we show that the heterogeneity in 
various economic integration agreements' (EIAs') partial effects on 
trade flows far exceeds that explained simply by variation in depth of 
the trade liberalization. Second, we use standard Armington- and 
Melitz-type general equilibrium trade models to motivate theoretically 
the roles of variable trade costs and fixed and variable export costs, 
respectively, for explaining (endogenous) heterogeneous partial effects 
of ad valorem tariff rates on trade flows, as well as on intensive and 
extensive product margins (with or without network effects and with a 
truncated or untruncated Pareto productivity distribution in the Melitz 
model). Third, we show empirically that the heterogeneity in EIAs' 
partial effects on the intensive margin is explained well just by 
distance and adjacency, capturing variable trade costs; however, the 
heterogeneity in EIAs' partial effects on the extensive margin is 
explained empirically by distance and adjacency, as well as several 
other cultural and institutional variables, capturing variable and fixed
 exports costs. Fourth, in the context of a class of standard 
quantitative trade models, we show that such estimated heterogeneous 
effects can predict 85-94 percent of economic welfare effects of EIAs 
and can potentially predict ex ante a potential EIA's partial trade-flow
 effect and general equilibrium welfare effect.</div>

 build a dynamic model of trade which allows us to study dynamic changes
 at both the intensive and extensive margins of trade. We show both 
theoretically and empirically (using 5-digit level SITC on trade for 
over 180 countries from 1962 to 2005) that economic integration 
agreements positively affect the stability of existing trade 
relationships, but negatively affect the stability of trade 
relationships which commence after an agreement is signed. Existing 
trade becomes more stable, while new trade becomes more fragile in the 
wake of an agreement. An agreement increases the growth rate of an 
already active trade relationship and makes it less likely to cease, 
while it has the opposite effect on relationships which start after the 
agreement. In addition, relationships which start after the agreement 
begin with lower values of trade than those that started before the 
agreement. Finally, agreements increase the rate of formation of new 
trade relationships between the two partner countries, likely indicating
 that the well-known increase in the value of trade that agreements 
induce is driven by extensive margin changes, rather than intensive

 neoclassical theory emphasizes the impact of trade on wage inequality 
between occupations and sectors, more recent theories of firm 
heterogeneity point to the impact of trade on wage dispersion within 
occupations and sectors. Using linked employer-employee data for Brazil,
 we show that much of overall wage inequality arises within 
sector-occupations and for workers with similar observable 
characteristics; this within component is driven by wage dispersion 
between firms; and wage dispersion between firms is related to firm 
employment size and trade participation. We then extend the 
heterogeneous-firm model of trade and inequality from Helpman, Itskhoki 
and Redding (2010) and structurally estimate it with Brazilian data. We 
show that the estimated model fits the data well, both in terms of key 
moments as well as in terms of the overall distributions of wages and 
employment, and find that international trade is important for this fit.
 In the estimated model, reduction in trade costs have a sizeable effect
 on wage inequality.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14423_abstract">Models
 have been extensively analyzed in economic methodology, notably their 
degree of ability to provide explanations. This paper takes a 
complementary, comparative approach, focusing on biology which – like 
economics – studies a highly complex reality. The aim is to propose a 
concept of theory and theory development, distinct from models, and to 
discuss the theory-model relationship.

Such a theory seeks to understand phenomena by combining core concepts 
relating to the causal mechanism with a broad range of evidence – 
including mechanistic and “difference-making” evidence. It is broad and 
descriptive, and evolves over time, becoming modified to accommodate new
 findings. Examples include the germ theory of disease, the theory of 
evolution by natural selection, and several physiological theories. 
Similar theories occur outside biology too, e.g. tectonic plate theory. 
They are phrased in the language of causation, not mathematics. 
Mathematical models can then be developed relating to specific 
components of the theory, e.g. epidemiological models of infectious 
diseases, and models of physiological processes such as the biophysics 
of the circulation. Thus, models are nested within the broader causal 
theory; crucially, scientists are therefore aware of what the model 
omits. 

Parallels do exist in economics, as in recent work on the nature and 
origin of money, but are atypical. Before the 2007-08 crisis, 
macroeconomic models notoriously assumed frictionless financial systems,
 obscuring problems originating in the financial sector.

Relatedly, the term “theory” is typically equated with models in 
economics. It tends to be based on axioms and assumptions, not on 
evidence as in e.g. biology – despite economists’ sophisticated and 
effective methods for causal inference and for testing predictions 
against evidence. These issues will be critically discussed in the light
 of the literature, including the influence of Friedman, notably his 
biological examples: the distribution of leaves on a tree, and the 
billiard player.</div>

 the science-policy interface one find advisory bodies that have to 
mediate between combined model-based and expertise-based knowledge on 
the one – scientific – side, and the demands of accurate information 
about the whereabouts of the economy on the other – political – side. 
The main tension these kinds of advisory bodies have to deal with is 
between the uncertain nature of scientific knowledge and the 
political-pragmatic requirement of factual knowledge. The main worry 
that induces this tension is that factual knowledge is considered to be 
value-neutral and so the acceptance of uncertainty as essential part of 
scientific knowledge would open the door for value judgements, which 
would endanger the scientific reputation of these advisory bodies as 
being neutral and independent.

To tame uncertainty, particularly in the mediation between climate 
science and climate-policy protocols and agreements, uncertainty 
management guidance systems have been developed. These guidance systems 
entail a framework that provides a uncertainty typology to manage 
uncertainty in an advisory body with the aim of improving its 
communication about uncertainty to its stake holders. So far they have 
only been used to define a standard vocabulary and have been studied as 
such. But these uncertainty management systems influence methodology, 
that is, the model design and the way these models will be validated. 
This paper will discuss a specific case in economics of this interaction
 between an uncertainty management guidance system and methodology, 
namely the current debates about this interaction at the CPB Netherlands

 paper explores the relationships between economics and psychology in 
the 1940s and 1950s by investigating the origin, the content, and the 
influence on economic analysis of two experiments on individual decision
 making performed in that period, namely by Frederick Mosteller and 
Philip Nogee, and by Donald Davidson, Patrick Suppes, and Sidney Siegel.

Both experiments had the same goal and overall structure: they aimed at 
measuring the utility of money of a number of individuals on the basis 
of their preferences between gambles where small amounts of real money 
were at stake. Both experiments relied on expected utility theory (EUT),
 and the utility measures they generated provided an indirect test for 
EUT’s validity.

Davidson, Suppes, and Siegel took into account some aspects of the 
psychology of decision that had been neglected by Mosteller and Nogee in
 order to neutralize them and thus obtain more reliable utility 
measures. Both groups of experimenters concluded that their findings 
supported the experimental measurability of utility as well as EUT.</div>

 school districts integrate charter schools for centralized admissions 
in Denver, New Orleans, Newark and Washington D.C., some charter schools
 have stayed out of the system. This is counterintuitive as centralized 
clearinghouses are deemed beneficial to schools as well as students. We 
provide a new framework to study the incentives of a school to join a 
clearinghouse and we show that each school prefers to remain out of the 
system when others join it for the standard mechanisms used in practice 
for student assignment. Therefore, our analysis provides an explanation 
of why some charter schools have evaded the clearinghouse. To overcome 
this issue, we propose two schemes that can be used by policymakers to 
incentivize schools to join the system, which achieves the desired 
integration of schools to the clearinghouse.</div>

 study the effect of different school choice mechanisms on schools’ 
incentives for quality improvement. To do so, we introduce the following
 criterion: A mechanism respects improvements of school quality if each 
school becomes weakly better off whenever that school improves, i.e., 
becomes more preferred by students. We first show that neither any 
stable mechanism nor mechanism that is Pareto efficient for students 
(such as the Boston and top trading cycles mechanisms) respects 
improvements of school quality. Nevertheless, for large school 
districts, we demonstrate that any stable mechanism approximately 
respects improvements of school quality; by contrast, the Boston and top
 trading cycles mechanisms fail to do so. Our simulations show that, 
even for small markets, stable mechanisms almost always respect 
improvements while the other two mechanisms frequently violate it. Thus,
 a stable mechanism may provide better incentives for schools to improve
 themselves than the Boston and top trading cycles mechanisms.</div>

 Top Trading Cycles mechanism emerges as a desirable solution in various
 market design applications. Yet recommendations are made without any 
rigorous foundation for the role priorities play in assignment. We 
explain that role by showing that there is a well-defined sense in which
 the Top Trading Cycle mechanism is (one of) the most stable mechanism 
among all Pareto-efficient and strategy-proof mechanisms. While, 
Pareto-efficiency, stability and strategy-proofness are three 
incompatible criteria, it is known that Gale and Shapley's individual

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14469_abstract">Many
 school districts allow students to report their preference rankings 
over schools and assign as many students as possible to their reported 
favorite schools. However, this well-intended assignment policy, known 
as the Boston mechanism, creates incentives for students to misreport 
their true preferences. I consider the problem of estimating students’ 
preference parameters with reported rankings under this policy. The 
challenge is that researcher does not observe who misreports and how. 
Previous literature has made strong assumptions about the who and the 
how. In this paper I relax these assumptions and propose a method to 
estimate preference parameters under the weaker assumptions. My 
identifying assumptions are that 1) students may have incorrect beliefs 
about their assignment probabilities as long as they correctly predict 
to which one of any given two schools they would have lower assignment 
probability; and 2) when deciding which ranking to report, students 
adhere to a simple rule: do not put a school on your ranking unless you 
prefer it to higher-probability ones. The ranking strategies that the 
previous literature has considered are special cases of the simple rule.
 I construct moment inequalities that partially identify the preference 
parameters and propose an estimator of a confidence region of the 
parameters. Finally, I apply the method to data from Seoul, Korea to 
compare the efficiency and inequity of the Boston mechanism with 
Deferred Acceptance, an alternative assignment policy without incentives
 to misreport. I find that the estimated bounds on the parameters are 
informative. Counterfactual simulations show that the Boston mechanism 
is more efficient than Deferred Acceptance, but it also penalizes 
students who naively report their true preferences.</div>

Minimum Wage Ordinance". In 2014, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance mandating
a $15 City minimum wage, which is to be phased in over a multi-year period beginning April
1, 2015. On that date, the minimum wage will increase from the Washington State minimum
of $9.47/hour to $11/hour. We present results on the short-term impact of the minimum
wage using data from a variety of sources: a survey of 700 Seattle-area employers, indepth
interviews with 40 area low-income workers with children, and systematic price data
collection from area grocery stores and other consumer retail outlets. In a labor market
where not all low-wage workers belong to low-income households, where low-income
households commonly receive means-tested benefits including SNAP and the EITC, and
where the expenditures of low-income house ds can largely be traced to establishments
that employ low-wage workers, we aim to me re the net impact of a higher minimum wage
on low-income households.</div>

 assess the Neumark, Salas and Wascher (NSW) critique of our minimum 
wage findings. Recent studies, including one by NSW, obtain small 
employment elasticities for restaurants, -0.06 or less in magnitude. The
 substantive critique in NSW thus centers primarily upon teens. Using a 
longer (1979-2014) sample than used by NSW and in our own previous work,
 we find clear evidence that teen minimum wage employment elasticities 
from a two-way fixed-effects panel model are contaminated by negative 
pre- existing trends. Simply including state-specific linear trends 
produces small and statistically insignificant estimates (around -0.07);
 including division-period effects further reduces the estimated 
magnitudes toward zero. A LASSO-based selection procedure indicates 
these controls for time-varying heterogeneity are warranted. Including 
higher order state trends does not alter these findings, contrary to 
NSW. Consistent with bias in the fixed-effects estimates from 
time-varying heterogeneity, first difference estimates are small or 
positive. Small, statistically insignificant, teen employment 
elasticities (around -0.06) obtain from border discontinuity design with
 contiguous counties. Contrary to NSW, such counties are more similar to
 each other than to other counties. Synthetic control studies also 
indicate small minimum wage elasticities (around -0.04). Nearby states 
receive significantly more weight in creating synthetic controls, 
providing further support for using regional controls. Finally, NSW’s 
preferred new matching estimates are plagued by a problematic sample 
that mixes treatment and control units, obtains poor matches, and shows 
the largest employment drops in areas with relative minimum wage 
declines.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14174_abstract">I look at wealth trends from 1962 to 2013. Asset prices plunged between 2007 and 2010 but
then rebounded from 2010 to 2013. The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted
by 44 percent over years 2007 to 2010, almost double the drop in housing prices, and by
2010 was at its lowest level since 1969. The inequality of net worth, after almost two decades
of little movement, was up sharply from 2007 to 2010. Relative indebtedness expanded from
2007 to 2010, particularly for the middle class, though the proximate causes were declining
net worth and income rather than an increase in absolute indebtedness. In fact, the average
debt of the middle class fell by 25 percent in real terms. The sharp fall in median net worth
and the rise in overall wealth inequality from 2007 to 2010 are traceable to the high leverage
of middle class families and the high share of homes in their portfolio. The racial and ethnic
disparity in wealth holdings widened considerably in the years between 2007 and 2010.
Hispanics, in particular, got hammered by the Great Recession in terms of net worth and net
equity in their homes. Young households (under age 45) also got pummeled by the Great
Recession, as their relative and absolute wealth declined sharply from 2007 to 2010. Rather
remarkably, there was virtually no change in median (and mean) wealth from 2010 to 2013
despite the rebound in asset prices, presenting a new puzzle. The proximate cause was
the high dissavings of the middle class. Rela indebtedness fell for the middle class as
outstanding debt continued to drop. Wealth uality and the racial and ethnic wealth gap
also remained largely unchanged, though there was some recovery of the net worth of young
households.</div>

productive or simply because luck has placed them at the top? Using data on the careers
and productivity of Major League Baseball players subject to the Vietnam War draft, we
find that negative shocks early in a potential superstar’s career dramatically diminish
labor market success. Birthdates chosen in the draft produce 17% fewer players who
eventually make the major leagues. Such effects are strongest at the top: all ten of the
ten most productive players of the era were born on undrafted birthdates. However, the
draft appears to matter precisely because drafted players are less productive. Players
born on drafted birthdates who make it to Major League Baseball produce 44% fewer wins
than those born on undrafted days, a gap that persists throughout their careers. Thus,
the underrepresentation of drafted men among Major League Baseball players reflects
differences in productivity. The large magnitude of the effects we observe, the relatively low
probability that a drafted individual served in the military, the direct effect on productivity
conditional on making the major leagues, a lack of similar effects in a league with a career
structure that shielded players from the draft, and concentration of the effects among junior
college graduates all suggest that career interruptions more generally, rather than military
service per se, drive our results. The similari etween the career paths of baseball players
and other salient superstars, such as investm bankers, suggests that our results have
implications for superstar labor markets more generally. Thus, we find that the identities
of the winners in a superstar labor market appear highly contingent, depending on random
shocks to early career experience, but these shocks matter precisely because the labor
market efficiently sifts for the most productive workers.</div>

recent decades, top incomes also became more cyclical. That concurrent increase in the&lt;br /&gt;
concentration and cyclicality of top incomes has been called "the rise of the high-beta&lt;br /&gt;

high-beta rich by applying a misspecification perspective to previous studies. The apparent&lt;br /&gt;
increase in the cyclicality of top incomes is an artifact of the increase in the concentration&lt;br /&gt;

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14587_abstract">Using
 data on aid for trade (AFT) inflows and a recent comprehensive 
estimates of bilateral trade costs data, we employ a multi-level mixed 
effects model and investigate: (1) the effect of AFT on bilateral trade 
costs, and (2) whether AFT from bilateral and multilateral sources 
complement each other in increasing the trade performances of 
recipients. In doing so, we distinguish among three pairs of trading 
partners: Recipients-and-Recipients, Recipients-and-Donors, and 
Recipients- and-Non-recipient-non-donor countries. Examining data 
spanning the years 2002 to 2012, we find a robust evidence indicating 
that AFT reduces bilateral trading costs of the recipients, more so 
among themselves than with donors. While we also find evidence 
indicating AFT from multilateral sources complements AFT from bilateral 
sources in increasing the trade performances of the recipients, we find 
considerable differences when comparing the observed effects across 
recipients in Africa with recipients in other regions. Taking into 
account these differences, we discuss the broader policy implications of
 our findings for increasing the effectiveness AFT in developing 
countries general, and African countries, in particular.</div>

 paper addresses whether public and private infrastructure investments 
promote long-run economic growth using panel data taken from the World 
Bank’s Economic Indicators (WDI) for a cross-section of 50 African 
countries spanning from 1995 to 2012. As measures of infrastructure, we 
use transportation (TRANS), improved access to sanitation (SANI), access
 to clean water (WATER), communication infrastructure (COMMU), and 
electricity infrastructure (ELEC) indices each of which ranges from 0 to
 100 (with 100 denoting robust infrastructure investments). We employ 
factor analysis to construct the above listed uncorrelated 5 broad 
infrastructure indices from a series of factors representing 
infrastructure investments. The panel unit-root test results show that 
the economic growth variable and the infrastructure indices are 
stationary in levels and first difference and they also exhibit long-run
 stable relationship as revealed by the Westerlund’s (2007) 
Error-correction model for panel data co-integration tests. Using Panel 
Fully Modified OLS (PFMOLS) model, we demonstrate that infrastructure 
investment indices have a positive and significant effect on the 
economic growth of African countries. Specifically, we find a bi-causal 
relationship between transportation, sanitation, communication, and 
electricity infrastructure and economic growth. On the other hand, we 
find a unidirectional impact of access to clean water on the economic 
growth of African countries in the sample.  Finally, we find positive 
and significant long-run response of economic growth (elasticity) to all
 the measures of infrastructure indices in this study, except for the 
case of electricity generation capacity while controlling for the 
conventional sources of economic growth.</div>

 explore the effects of foreign aid on FDI in a large number of 
aid-recipient countries using data since the mid-1980s. We control for 
the various determinants of FDI and we specifically include the 
interplay of aid with social cohesion and the interplay of aid with 
human capital. The empirical results from dynamic GMM estimations 
indicate that the independent impact of aid on FDI is negative in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin America (LAC) and positive in other 
regions. Aid in countries with high levels of human capital discourages 
FDI, implying that human capital and FDI are substitutes. The interplay 
of aid and social cohesion in SSA and LAC has an inverted-U relationship
 with FDI, implying diminishing returns to social cohesion in these two 
regions. On the other hand, the effects from the interplay of aid and 
social cohesion in other regions have a U shape, implying the presence 
of a threshold effect to social cohesion. Interestingly, once we control
 for human capital, aid, and social cohesion, we do not find strong 
evidence of a significant role of governance. We discuss the policy 
implications of these findings.</div>

 the World Bank Enterprise Surveys data for Ethiopia (2006 and 2011) and
 Kenya (2007 and 2013), this study empirically investigates the 
significance of exports and foreign ownership in influencing firm-level 
efficiency. We estimate a standard Cobb-Douglas production function 
using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. In addition to the two variables of 
interest, we control for firm characteristics, including firm size, type
 of industry, innovation activity, and employees’ characteristics in our
 efficiency analysis.  The results of the study show that, in both 
Ethiopia and Kenya, exporting helps firms lower technical inefficiency, 
whereas higher share of foreign ownership has the expected sign but not 
statistically significant. The results also confirm that, in both 
countries, smaller firms and firms that employ temporary workers for a 
longer periods of time tend to be less efficient. For Kenyan firms, 
experience of managers of a firm helps to lower technical inefficiency, 
however, innovation activities within a firm tends to raise 
inefficiency; whereas for the case of Ethiopian firms experience of 
managers lowers efficiency, albeit weakly, and innovation activities do 
not appear to affect firm efficiency. Our robustness analysis on the 
nexus between exporting and productivity confirms that one-size-fits-all
 causal relationship is not valid. We conclude that policy-makers in 
Ethiopia and Kenya should look into these key variables in designing 
appropriate policy to improve firm efficiency in their endeavor for 
industrialization.</div>

 the long term, there is substantial linkage between economic growth and
 the performance of financial markets. This paper aims to capture such 
co-movements between the real economy and financial markets in the past 
decades. It provides long-term investors useful guidance on how to 
select their investment portfolios based on related economic variables. 
The investigation of co-movements among financial instruments helps 
investors with risk hedging by avoiding co-moved instruments in their 
portfolios. In our paper, we implement a dynamic factor model to capture
 unobserved co-movements between economic variables and financial 
benchmark securities over the period of 1987-2014. The results of the 
multi-factor model show high correlation between the financial market 
and the real economy. Bond indexes appear highly co-moved with economic 
variables. The stock market shows significant co-movement both with the 
economic variables, and within the stock market itself. This study 
provides a comprehensive evidence of broad long-term co-movement between
 a set of financial market and macroeconomic variables. Without trying 
to predict the future, it provides useful information for long-term 
investors about the past trends in financial market and the amount of 
risk associated with long-term investments. This study fills the gap in 
the existing literature and shows the presence of common factor that 
affects both financial markets and real economy.</div>

 research investigates three important factors of increasing income 
inequality in the United States. The three factors are globalization, 
technical change, and education. We investigate each factor to find the 
major factor of increasing income inequality in the United States. We 
find that each one contributes to income inequality in different ways. 
Both globalization and technical change result in a demand for higher 
educated or skilled individuals in the United States. This has led us to
 further investigate how education affects income inequality. The 
factors of education that we investigate are socioeconomic status, 
inherited genetic ability, credit markets, and incomplete information. 
All of these factors play a role in educational attainment. We find that
 socioeconomic status and inherited genetic ability are the most 
significant factors of educational attainment. In conclusion, this 
research finds that education is the major factor of increasing income 
inequality in the United States.</div>

 research establishes that the emergence, prevalence, recurrence, and 
severity of intrastate conflicts in the modern era reflect the long 
shadow of prehistory. Exploiting variations across national populations,
 it demonstrates that genetic diversity, as determined predominantly 
during the exodus of humans from Africa tens of thousands of years ago, 
has contributed significantly to the frequency, incidence, and onset of 
both overall and ethnic civil conflict over the last half-century, 
accounting for a large set of geographical and institutional correlates 
of conflict, as well as measures of economic development. Furthermore, 
the analysis establishes the significant contribution of genetic 
diversity to the intensity of social unrest and to the incidence of 
intragroup factional conflict. These findings arguably reflect the 
contribution of genetic diversity to the degree of fractionalization and
 polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups in the 
national population; the adverse influence of genetic diversity on 
interpersonal trust and cooperation; the contribution of genetic 
diversity to divergence in preferences for public goods and 
redistributive policies; and the potential impact of genetic diversity

 developing country governments and international experts see high-value
 agricultural exports, such as fruits and vegetables, as an important 
opportunity for economic growth and poverty reduction. Little is known, 
however, about the effects of agricultural exports in fragile and 
conflict-affected countries. We exploit movements in world market prices
 combined with geographic variation in crop intensity to provide 
evidence that increases in the value of two agricultural export crops – 
bananas and sugar – led to increases in the intensity of civil conflict 
in the Philippines. Importantly, we show that market structure matters: 
the effect is large for bananas of the Cavendish variety, which are 
grown for highly concentrated export chains, but small and statistically
 insignificant for varieties that are grown for decentralized domestic 
markets. Our results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that armed 
insurgent groups fund themselves by extorting large agricultural export 
firms, and robust to instrumenting the world banana price with rainfall 
in Ecuador, the world’s largest banana exporter. We find no evidence 
that conflict is affected by the value of the country’s two most 
important staple crops – rice and maize – which are almost entirely 
consumed in the domestic market.</div>

 reactions to terrorism may be displayed in different ways. While some 
individuals react by holding back on their financial and charitable 
activities following stressful events, others may express more 
generosity by increasing their giving due to solidarity and empathy with
 the victims, or out of heightened nationalism and patriotism. Using a 
longitudinal analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a case 
study to uncover the relations between terrorism and philanthropic 
behavior, we find that terror attacks considerably increase the scope of
 giving by individuals and households. Our empirical approach relies on a
 unique panel data set of 152,731 tax itemizer philanthropists and 
terrorism data from 1999 to 2011. The results are statistically 
significant and robust across a multitude of model specifications. 
Furthermore, we use a novel instrumental variable approach to identify a
 causal link and address potential endogeneity concerns. This study is, 
to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to empirically identify 
and quantify the effect of sequential terror attacks on philanthropy 
over a relatively long period using detailed micro-level information.</div>

 paper provides a theoretical framework for quantitatively investigating
 the optimal accumulation of international reserves as a hedge against 
rollover risk. We study a dynamic model of endogenous default in which 
the government faces a tradeoff between the insurance benefits of 
reserves and the cost of keeping larger gross debt positions. A 
calibrated version of our model is able to rationalize large holdings of
 international reserves, as well as the procyclicality of reserves and 
gross debt positions. Model simulations are also consistent with spread 
dynamics and other key macroeconomic variables in emerging economies. 
The benefits of insurance arrangements and the effects of restricting

 study the role of bond maturity in generating multiple equilibria in 
the Eaton-Gersovitz model of sovereign debt. In the case of one-period 
debt, the Eaton-Gersovitz model features a unique equilibrium, as 
recently shown by Auclert and Rognlie (15). We show that, when the 
government is more impatient than foreign financial markets, for 
intermediate levels of maturity there exist at least two equilibria. One
 of the equilibria features a high bond price and low level steady state
 debt. The other features a low bond price and a high level of steady 
state debt. We discuss how distinct elasticities of the bond price to 
the quantity of debt issued are key in generating the multiplicity. 
Relatedly, we show that proposed policy interventions to mitigate the 
effect of self-fulfilling debt crises can backfire because, although 
they target the level of the bond price, they also inadvertently change 
its elasticity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14212_abstract">In
 this paper we use a benchmark model of sovereign debt to quantify the 
importance of non-fundamental risk in driving interest rate spreads 
during the euro-area sovereign debt crisis. Our model features debt 
maturity choices, risk averse lenders and rollover crises a la Cole and 
Kehoe (2000). In this environment, lenders' expectations of a default 
can be self-fulfilling, and their beliefs contribute to variation in 
interest rate spreads along with economic fundamentals. We show that 
maturity choices of the government are informative about the prospect of
 a future self-fulfilling crisis. The government can reduce the 
occurrence of these inefficient runs by lengthening the maturity of its 
debt. Hence, when rollover problems are pressing, we should observe an 
increase in debt maturity. After fitting the model to observed maturity 
choices, we find that rollover risk accounts on average for 23% of 
Italian interest rate spreads during the episode, 14% in 2012:Q2. Our 
results have implications for the effects of liquidity provisions like 
the OMT program announced by the European Central Bank during the summer
 of 2012.</div>

 Simon asked: how do human beings reason when the conditions for 
rationality postulated by neoclassical economics are not met? The answer
 to this question, the study of bounded rationality, has been 
interpreted as merely descriptive, and sometimes even as constructing a 
list of reasoning errors. In contrast, I ask whether the study of 
bounded rationality, understood as the analysis of behavior in 
situations where optimization is out of reach (i.e., uncertainty, not

 Can the study of heuristics and their ecological rationality tell us

 A. Simon’s The Sciences of the Artificial is to the realm of artifacts 
(in the widest sense of the word, meaning that which is made) what 
Thomas S. Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is to the

natural scientists understand the natural world, so also Simon’s 
Sciences framed a new theory about how ‘scientists of the artificial’ – 
engineers, technologists, designers, planners, clinicians, policy 
makers, administrators – make and understand the artificial world. One 
of the most intriguing consequences of Sciences is that it has offered 
the nucleus of a paradigm for the study of creativity – not only in the 
sciences (where Kuhn’s Structure also has deep relevance) but in all 
realms of creativity. In this essay I discuss how Sciences of the 
Artificial contribute to this paradigm, the shape of the paradigm itself

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10427_abstract">In
 the conventional economic wisdom the notion of unique equilibria that 
are efficient and Pareto Optimal dominates the modeling discourse. 
Hebert Simon proposed an  alternative analytical framework where the 
notion of multiple and sustainable equilibria is of critical importance.
 It is multiple as opposed to unique equilibria that is the crucial 
stylized fact of economic life that requires better understanding and 
modeling. Of particular significance, Simon focused on the importance of
 institutions and differential power relationships in affecting economic
 outcomes. Simon was especially appreciative of the American 
institutionalists, with a special focus on the contributions of John 
Commons. But this modeling approach was not well developed by Simon. 
Following from the contributions of Herbert Simon, I extend and further 
develop the notion of multiple equilibria especially in the realm of 
production with an emphasis on x-efficiency theory. Given the 
reasonableness of multiple equilibria, I bring to bear the importance of
 institutional parameters (including power relationships), culture, 
norms, ethics and moral sentiments to the determination of economic 
outcomes (which of the possible multiple equilibria set dominates). In 
the model developed here, individuals are rational decision makers 
making choices that are contextualized and constrained by complex 
environmental factors. No choice is inevitable; a function of market 
forces. Moreover, individual and socially welfare maximizing outcomes 
are not inevitable. A multiplicity of outcomes is possible. Much depends
 on individual preferences and institutional design. That sub-optimal 
outcomes are possible and sustainable from this multiple equilibria 
modeling framework had important implication for analysis and public 
policy.</div>

 year the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released a new experimental 
account that tracks national health care spending by medical condition. 
 These statistics improve upon our understanding of the health sector by
 blending together both medical claims data and survey data to present 
measures of national spending and cost of treatment by condition.  This 
paper introduces key aspects of this account and uses it to study the 
spending slowdown over the 2000 to 2010 period.  The account reveals 
that the slowdown is driven by a reduction in cost per case growth, but 
spending trends can vary greatly across conditions and affect the 
slowdown differently. Over half of the overall slowdown can be accounted
 for by circulatory conditions. However, disease categories that include
 diabetes, back problems, and preventative services see a more dramatic 
rate of slowdown.  In contrast, categories that include migraines,

 paper analyzes how global aeronautics and aircraft patent data reflect 
technological, industrial, and geopolitical events from 1880 to 1916. We
 examine detailed information on more than 8000 aeronautics and aviation
 patents, the majority of those granted globally in this period.  
France, Germany, Britain, and the U.S. had by far the most applications.
 Trends were similar across these countries. Early inventors, inspired 
by curiosity, almost never assigned patent rights to firms. Annual 
aeronautical patents grew gradually through 1907, then rose steeply as 
an airplane industry emerged. Increasingly patents were held by firms, 
associated with more formal research and development. The Wright 
brothers’ patent effectively blocked other U.S. firms and led to legal 
battles and eventually a patent pool. During World War I, patent filings
 declined, especially in France and Germany. Trends in technology areas,
 e.g. balloons, wings, and military applications, were similar across 
countries. Similar findings are likely in other cases where scientific 
and technological developments led to the appearance of new industries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14322_abstract">Productivity
 differences across industries within each country play a major role in 
explaining international trade. But, what is behind these productivity 
differences? This paper finds that labor with post-secondary education 
is the main determinant of productivity because it enables technology 
adoption. I use a variant of the principal component analysis to 
decompose productivity differences into country- and industry-specific 
components. This approach turns out to be successful empirically, in 
contrast to the previous evidence on the Heckscher-Ohlin model. I 
consider several candidates to match principal country- 
industry-specific components of productivity: physical capital, labor 
with various levels of education, and institutions. I find that labor 
with tertiary education is the best match. Analysis of the data on 
foreign technology licensing also leads to the conclusion that it is 
educated labor rather than institutions that is the main cause of 
productivity differences. Evidence on occupations, patents, and 
technology licensing shows that the main function of labor with tertiary
 education is to enable technology adoption. Based on this evidence, I 
develop a model in which comparative advantage is endogenous and 
technology adoption is driven by highly educated labor. I show that this
 model does a good job explaining comparative advantages.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13940_abstract">Abstract:
 The prospect that high concentration will lead to the exercise of 
market power justifies many regulatory policies toward mobile services 
including radio spectrum caps, facilities sharing rules, and 
cross-ownership restrictions; it also plays a central role in antitrust 
enforcement of telecommunications mergers.  This paper tests the 
validity of a causal relationship between concentration among mobile 
service providers and the market outcomes for mobile consumers.  &lt;br 
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A panel dataset was assembled from public sources, covering the FCC’s 
172 Economic Areas over the 12 year period 2002-2013.  Concentration was
 measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of carriers’ 
subscribership and their spectrum holdings.  Consumer welfare was 
measured by subscriber penetration rates, thereby avoiding the many 
pitfalls of price measurement.  Fixed effects regressions relate 
penetration to concentration controlling for landline and mobile prices,
 along with an array of demographic variables.  We find that consumption
 of mobile services is directly related to both subscriber and spectrum 
concentration.  The preferred quadratic specification confirms that peak
 penetration is reached at HHIs that are far below typical concentration
 levels found in the U.S. markets.  These results persist when we 
instrument for the likely endogeneity of industry concentration.  &lt;br
 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Policy debates over mobile service regulation have raised concerns that 
market power is particularly pernicious in low-density rural markets.  
Adopting the Federal Communications Commission definition of “rural,” we
 again find penetration rates are positively related to market 
concentration, though rural markets are more concentrated on average.  
In addition, we separately test claims that concentration of spectrum 
held in the lower frequency ranges more likely leads to monopolistic 
conduct.  Specifically, we do not find that HHIs of carrier holdings 
below 1 GHz are negatively related to mobile penetration rates.  &lt;br 
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we explore factors that determine subscriber concentration.  
Contrary to some claims, we do not find that spectrum concentration 
translates directly to subscriber concentration.  We find, instead, that
 market concentration is explained, in part, by the quality of mobile 
services as measured by engineering speed tests, affirming that carriers
 that deliver good quality service will tend to grow relative to those 
who do not.  In the end, evidence is lacking that would rationalize 
policies designed to prevent or reverse concentration in mobile services
 for the purpose of promoting consumer interests.</div>

 With responses to an in-depth survey of 2,216 residential customers, 
complementary data from geo-coded public sources, aggregate assessments 
of performance by J.D. Power Associates from their independent surveys, 
 historical records of individual customer usage and bill payments, 
streams of published media content and records of actual service 
delivery, we examine how measures of customer satisfaction are 
interrelated and how they relate to account activity, customer 
characteristics,  and  actual service delivery.  We test our inferences 
against published J.D. Power ratings for 16 large Midwestern utilities 
in the same peer group.  We find that ratings on different service 
dimensions are highly correlated and related to the customers’ total 
expenditures for electric service.  Customer ratings for quality and 
reliability of service reflect their sentiments about frequency of 
outages, duration of outages and the communications that customers 
receive while power is being restored.  Relationships with the actual 
reliability of service delivered to customers’ residences are much

 In recent years, the federal programs designed to promote universal 
telecommunications services to low-income households have been expanded 
to cover wireless as well as wireline services. This has greatly 
increased the cost of these programs, resulting in calls for reforms. In
 this paper I utilize a uniquely disaggregated household-level data set 
from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine the effects 
of the primary low-income program, Lifeline, as well as the effect of 
its extension to wireless service. The results indicate that the 
Lifeline program increases the house- hold’s propensity to subscribe to a
 phone service. However, based on the counterfactual experiments, only 
one out of eight households that receive the subsidy subscribes to 
telephone service because of the subsidy. The extension of the Lifeline 
subsidy to include prepaid wireless service has attracted additional 
subscribers. However, the counterfactual experiment shows that only one 
out of twenty households enrolled in the wireless Lifeline subscribes to
 telephone service because of the subsidy.</div>

been sluggish in the United States, and more so in a number of other 
developed economies. This has given rise to a literature about possible 
secular stagnation (Eichengreen 2015; Gordon 2014a, 2014b; Krugman 2014;
 Summers 2013, 2014). This paper argues that the cause of the sluggish 
recovery in the U.S. is the transformation of the prevailing 
"free-market," or "neoliberal," institutional structure from a structure
 that had promoted capital accumulation for some 25 years into an 
obstacle to further normal expansion following the crisis of 2008-09. 
The paper cites historical evidence of previous periods in which 
stagnation gave way to normal long-run expansion only after a new 
institutional structure had emerged. Drawing on the “social structure of
 accumulation” theory of accumulation and crisis, the paper argues that 
the observed pattern of crisis, stagnation, institutional restructuring,
 and long-lasting normal growth is not an accident but is rooted in the 
central role in the promotion of normal capital accumulation that is 
played by a coherent, mutually reinforcing set of economic and political
 institutions which, however, cannot play that role indefinitely.</div>

 are common; depressions are rare.  This paper argues that there is a 
distinction between economic recessions and depressions and this 
distinction helps to explain why economic recovery can be weaker and 
take longer.  
     The paper will argue that the ultimate cause of recessions and 
depressions is a decline in profitability in the business sector of an 
economy.  The Keynesians (supporters of fiscal expansion) and Austerians
 (supporters of fiscal contraction) deny the role of profitability in 
recessions and depressions. So their prescriptions for recovery do not 
work.  The paper will offer empirical evidence from the US economy to 
support this thesis.  
     But not every depression is the same: each has its own 
characteristics.  The distinctive feature of the current depression is 
the role of excessive credit or debt.  Evidence will be presented to 
argue that the Federal Reserve quantitative easing programme had little 
positive effect on US real GDP or investment growth and merely fuelled a
 new stock and bond market boom.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14455_abstract">Basing
 themselves on the actual experience of the 1930s, a fundamental insight
 offered by Keynes, Kalecki and subsequent advocates of what became 
Post-Keynesian economics is that, when responding to a major crisis, the
 economic system is not self-adjusting.  In a modern monetary capitalist
 economy, private sector stabilizing forces do exist; but, at best, they
 can be considered very weak, while the destabilizing elements tend to 
dominate. This underlying asymmetry would suggest that, in the absence 
of public sector policies to counteract such instabilities, the 
inexorable outcome of a deep crisis is long-term stagnation. In contrast
 to other heterodox economists, especially from the Marxian tradition, 
Post-Keynesians believe that it is possible even within a capitalist 
economy to counteract effectively these destabilizing tendencies through
 appropriate macroeconomic policy actions of the state, as it happened 
to some extent during the post-World War II “Golden Age”. 
The object of the paper will be to explore both theoretically and 
empirically the properties of these destabilizing factors so as to shed 
some light on the nature of the present crisis. A significant insight 
offered by Keynes in the General Theory and explored by some 
Post-Keynesians historically has to do with the importance of the 
fundamental interaction between the rentier and non-rentier sectors of 
the modern capitalist economy, which can both trigger the crisis and 
abort the recovery. In particular, once a financial crisis occurs, which
 usually results from the destabilizing actions of the rentier sector, 
macroeconomic policy often works in such a way as to maintain the 
economy in a state of high long-term unemployment. Such a scenario of 
long-term stagnation, characteristic of the 1930s, is being played out 
again today and we shall explore possible long-term measures to pull 
economies out of what has clearly become a macroeconomic austerity trap.</div>

 more likely to comply with the law by enrolling in distance education

 puzzles emerge from the literature on the health of immigrants and 
their descendants. The first is the assimilation puzzle of why Hispanic 
natives often lag well behind non-Hispanic whites on measures of health.
 The second, sometimes referred to as the Hispanic Health Paradox, is 
the puzzle of immigrant advantage, that is, why Hispanic immigrants 
sometimes appear to be in better health than U.S.-born Hispanics. While 
numerous studies have offered potential explanations for these patterns,
 virtually all health studies of the descendants of immigrants rely on 
subjective measures of ethnic self-identification rather than on more 
objective measures of lineage. Consequently, “ethnic attrition” occurs 
whenever a U.S.-born descendant of a Hispanic immigrant fails to 
self-identify as Hispanic. Using data on children from the 1996-2014 
Current Population Survey March Supplement, we show that Mexican ethnic 
attrition is sizable and highly selective on health, making subsequent 
generations of Mexican immigrants appear less healthy than they actually
 are. The mechanism through which selective ethnic attrition occurs is 
intermarriage, which we show is positively selected on health. As a 
result, we conclude that the twin puzzles of poor assimilation and 
immigrant advantage have likely been overstated.</div>

 Americans obtain private health insurance for themselves and their 
families through the workplace. Using a national sample of adults age 
18-64 from the 2010-2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we 
estimate that only 40 percent of the Mexican American men in the labor 
force are covered by private health insurance coverage as compared to 72
 percent of other non-Mexican origin men. What accounts for the 
difference in private insurance coverage between Mexican American men 
and other workers? Is the difference explained by age, education, 
nativity, language, or other human capital characteristics which would 
affect access to private health insurance? In our study, nearly 60% of 
Mexican American men in the labor force are foreign born, 35% have an 
educational attainment less than a high school degree, and 40% are 
likely to have language barriers. Is the insurance disparity caused by 
these human capital characteristics and is the disparity compounded by 
discrimination encountered by Mexican American men in the workplace and 
their access to private health insurance coverage? What if Mexican 
American men had similar characteristics as those of other workers, 
would their predicted private health insurance coverage be as favorable 
as other workers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To study the determinants of private health insurance among Mexican 
American men, we use the public use sample data from the 2010-2013 NHIS.
 The NHIS provides an alternative to other national data surveys (e.g. 
Current Population Survey, Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey) which are frequently used to estimate the insurance coverage 
among Hispanics. Logit equations are estimated separately for the 
determinants of private insurance coverage among Mexican Americans and 
other men. A decomposition analysis is used to explain the disparity in 
insurance coverage. Preliminary results show that age, low educational 
attainment, being foreign-born, and language barriers diminished the 
probability of private insurance coverage for Mexican Americans.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14012_abstract">It
 has been well-documented the tendency of adult immigrants to converge 
to unhealthy health status levels through years living in the US.  This 
paper looks at another focus of this topic.  We analyze children of 
immigrants’ healthy immigrant effect using as main indicators parental 
immigrant cohort and year of arrival together with region of birth.  
Using data from Integrated National Health Interview Survey 2000-2014, 
we evaluate children of immigrants’ health status by using BMI levels 
and the number of visits to the doctor versus their native counterparts.
  Following the consensus in the literature, I define ‘child of 
immigrant’ any child who has one or both parents are foreign-born, and 
‘child of native’ otherwise.
The hypothesis is that, consistent with their parents, children of 
immigrant family’s health status declines the longer they, and their 
parents, remain in the United States.  However, we should see an 
increase in the number of visits to the doctor the more years they, and 
their parents, have resided in the country.  The study uses the current 
econometric techniques developed in the literature by considering the 
issue of zero mass accumulation and underline differential distributions
 to account for selection issues and unobservables.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14291_abstract">Our
 vantage point is how institutions relate to individual agency: Can 
institutions be fully integrated into the individual decision making 
process, e.g. as constraints in an individual optimization problem? Or 
do we need to understand them as ontological objects proper shaping and 
being shaped by individual agency? The former, mechanistic, approach 
stands for the individualism advocated by mainstream and New 
Institutional economics. The latter represents the systemic and 
interactive approach of evolutionary-institutional and social 
economists. In praxis it is, however, difficult to discriminate between 
the two approaches: the corresponding models are simply too different to
 be compared meaningfully. Agent-based modeling provides a solution to 
this problem as it is the only approach that is, in principle, capable 
of integrating both approaches. It allows discriminating between the two
 different ontologies in one coherent model. The consequences of the 
ontological decision for an interactive and evolutionary perspective on 
social institutions are non-trivial: our simulations show that a 
mechanistic approach does not suffice to understand the interactive and 
evolutionary character of institutions. Only if institutions are 
considered ontological entities proper, we can understand their 
functioning, their potential independence of their initial purpose, and 
how they shape individual agency. We discuss the implications of this 
result for the instrumental and ceremonial dimensions of institutions, 
and institutional change. Our paper also illustrates the usefulness of 
an agent-based-computational approach for the study of the nature and 
evolution of institutions, and their role in the social-economic 
provisioning process.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14292_abstract">John
 R. Commons argued that economic value should be defined on the basis of
 the contribution of individuals to the net wealth of the community. 
There should be legal protection for activities that expand the 
commonwealth, and penalties for entities that generate income by 
capturing a larger share from others in zero-sum exchanges underwritten 
by positional power. In Commons’ time, much of the value-added in the 
macroeconomy came from industrial processes generating tradeable goods: 
trade with other communities. Today the challenge is different; value 
generation takes a more abstract form, and is centralized in large 
cities. The challenge then for cities at a distance from such centres is
 then to develop autonomous – circular – logics of circulation. 
How to do this? is a driving question. We explore some alternatives for 
cities that have been forcefully affected by the subprime crisis in the 
central valley of California, in communities very distant from the urban
 engines of California growth. 
Following Commons, we attempt to rethink the basis of economic value for
 these cities, which lack engines of economic growth, with their 
residents now stripped of homeownership and their local governments 
lacking fiscal capacity. We use the ideas of provisioning developed by 
Ben Fine and others, and of the logic of reinvestment (Chiong 2014) to 
formulate some ideas on creating viable circular economies. The needed 
reinvestment -  in the people, the places, and infrastructures that 
sustain everyday life -  will require the intermixing of non-monetized 
transactions with financial exchanges.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14293_abstract">This
 paper studies the economic effects of the weak housing market on 
households in the United States. Roughly 20% of people in the United 
States with mortgages owe more than their homes are worth (i.e., 
underwater). An additional 20% of households are barely above water—they
 could not sell their homes without incurring a loss (if they could sell
 their homes at all). As a result, these people are locked into their 
homes with several effects. First, labor mobility is reduced because 
many people are tied to their homes; so, they cannot move if a better 
job opportunity presents itself or if unemployed they cannot move even 
if offered a job if it is not within commuting distance. Second, small 
businesses are responsible for almost all net job growth in the United 
States over the past 20 years, and home equity is a popular source of 
startup business financing. This relationship accounts for some of the 
significant reduction in startups over the past several years. Third, 
consumers have deleveraged some of their consumer debt since the Great 
Recession, but significant outstanding debt still remains. And debt such
 as student loans continues to rise. Underwater and barely-above-water 
mortgages are constraining the United States economy, and based on the 
size and resiliency it is difficult to imagine this problem being 
resolved without public policy intervention.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14294_abstract">It
 is in the nature of economic practice that economists routinely cause 
harm as they try to do good. The profession has nevertheless been slow 
to recognize “econogenic” or economist-induced harm. Those operating on 
the terrain of mainstream neoclassical theory have typically managed to 
domesticate economist-induced harm with the mechanical decision rules 
provided by the Kaldor-Hicks compensation test and related cost-benefit 
analyses. Moreover, the profession has missed some of the central ways 
in which its work harms. 

Taking a broad view, the paper presents and explores the concept of an 
“economy harm profile” to assess the harms that arise within a given 
economy. An economy harm profile is given by the nature of the 
prevalent, averted and covered harms; the distribution of harms; the 
rationale for harms; the mechanisms of harm inducement (and 
distribution); and the degree of coercion that is associated with 
harm-generating processes.  The paper contends that there is much to be 
gained through the comparison of distinct economy harm profiles—not 
least, economy harm profile analysis might help the economics profession
 to design and implement reforms that eliminate gratuitous harms and 
ameliorate necessary harms.</div>

these topics in the extant literature. Therefore, we focus on an arbitrary region in a developing
country and then analyze the creative capital accumulation decision faced by workers in this region
who aspire to membership in the so called creative class. Specifically, we compute the present
discounted value of a worker’s lifetime earnings as a function of the primitives of the problem. Next,
we solve for the level of education that maximizes the lifetime earnings function. Finally, we
describe how this optimal level of education is affected by changes in the lifespan of workers, the
interest rate, and by the growth rate of the wage function.</div>

 housing activity in the country, high already, is expected to further 
accelerate in the next few years, mainly because the government has 
already announced that it is committed to provide a house for all by 
2022. The increased activity will impact the housing markets as a change
 in the house price affects the households’ perceived lifetime wealth 
and hence inﬂuences the spending and borrowing decisions of households. 
Further, house price gains increase housing collateral and hence housing
 credits. The potential two-way link between bank lending and house 
prices give rise to mutually reinforcing cycles in credit and real 
estate markets. The increasing dominance of the sector necessitated 
setting up of a mechanism which could track the movement of prices in 
the residential housing segment. Therefore, it becomes necessary to 
prepare an accurate measure of aggregate house price, despite limited 
availability of data, in order to understand the behavior of housing 
markets and their inﬂuence on the economy.  To understand about house 
prices, it is important to understand about housing indices. In India, 
NHB and RBI construct and release an index each, RESIDEX and HPI, 
respectively. In case of both the indices there are a number of

through short-term interest rates and various monetary policy measures. His conjectures about
the determinants of long-term interest rates were made in the context of advanced capitalist
economies, and were based on his views on ontological uncertainty and the formation of
investors’ expectations. Are these conjectures valid in emerging markets, such as India? This
paper empirically investigates the determinants of changes in Indian government bonds’
nominal yields. Changes in short-term interest rates, after controlling for other crucial variables
such as changes in the rates of inflation and economic activity, take a lead role in driving
changes in the nominal yields of Indian government bonds. This vindicates Keynes’s theories,
and suggests that his views on long-term interest rates are also applicable to emerging markets.
Higher fiscal deficits do not appear to raise government bond yields in India. It is further argued
that Keynes’s conjectures about investors’ outlooks, views, and expectations are fairly robust in
a world of ontological uncertainty.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13916_abstract">This paper estimates the causal effect of a unique program of corporate debt restructuring (CDR)
on stability of Indian banks for the period 1992-2012. The banks who participated in the program
were extended regulatory forbearance on asset classification and provisioning on the restructured
corporate loans. We find that banking stability of the participated banks increases substantially after
the implementation of the program. Following the recent development in measuring market
power, we estimate efficiency-adjusted Lerner indices along with conventional one using stochastic
frontier analysis approach (Koetter, Kolari and Spierdijk, 2012), and check for the interactive effect
of CDR on bank stability. The result shows that the positive effect of CDR on stability declines at
the higher degree of market power of the participated banks. To provide unbiased treatment effects
of CDR eliminating any sample selection problem, we confirm our result using a number of
alternative matching estimators including recently developed bias-corrected covariate matching
estimator proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2006). Investigating the ambiguous trade-off between
market power and stability, we find that greater pricing power reduces risk-taking behavior of
banks. It also reveals that although the second phase of deregulation improved overall banking
stability significantly, there is a threshold level of market power below which banks experience a
higher risk of fragility. Our results remain insensitive to an array of robustness tests.</div>

observed patterns. We find that online sellers are more likely to be 
located in existing industrial clusters, where thousands of firms are 
concentrated in one place and produce one major product. Online shopping
 has developed more rapidly in less populated areas. E-commerce has 
enabled people in remote places to access a wider range of commodities 
which in turn expands the market size of industrial clusters. This 
creates a winner-takes-all phenomenon -- the growth rate of e-commerce 
among the top 10% of clusters is much higher than other places.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14308_abstract">Trust
 is vital for market development, but how can trust be enhanced in a 
marketplace? A common view is that more trusting may help to build 
trust, especially in less developed economies. In this paper, we argue 
that more trusting may lead to less trust. We set up a rational 
expectation model in which a marketplace uses buyer protection to 
promote buyer trusting. Our results show that buyer protection may 
reduce trust in equilibrium and even hinder market expansion because it 
triggers differential entry between honest and strategic sellers and may
 induce more cheating from strategic sellers. Using a large 
transaction-level data set from the early years of Eachnet.com (an eBay 
equivalent in China), we find evidence that is consistent with the model
 predictions. Stronger buyer protection leads to less favorable 
evaluation of seller behavior and is associated with slower market 
expansion. These findings suggest that a trust-promoting policy aiming 
at buyer trusting may not be effective if it is not accompanied by 
additional incentives to improve seller trustworthiness.</div>

 developing countries, due to imperfect institutions and less developed 
financial markets, entrepreneurs face an enormous entry barrier. In the 
wake of weak institutions, they primarily rely on their own social 
networks to access credit and customers when running a business. 
However, it is costly to build up and maintain a social network. For 
those outside the network, the entry barrier is prohibitively high. The 
mode of online shops greatly lowers the cost of starting and running a 
business, opening up space for many new entrepreneurs with limited 
financial and social capital who otherwise would not have been able to 
set up their own businesses. Based on a large primary survey on more 
than 400 online shops and physical shops in a wholesale market in 
Baigou, the top Taobao village (according to Alibaba) and largest bag 
and suitcase production cluster in China, we are able to test this idea.
 Our results provide strong support for our hypothesis. Among the 
physical shop owners in the wholesale market, most of them are local and
 have engaged in their business for a long time. In contrast, most of 
the online shop owners are former migrant workers who have started their
 businesses with much less capital. E-commerce provides the outsiders an
 opportunity to fulfil their entrepreneurial ambitions.</div>

 three eras: the Late Imperial Era, 1644-1911, the Republican Era, 
1912-49 and the Communist Era, 1949-2012. Was the economic stagnation of
 the late Qing era associated with low intergenerational mobility rates?
 Did the short lived Republic achieve greater social mobility after the 
demise of the centuries long Imperial exam system, and the creation of 
modern Westernized education? The exam system was abolished in 1905, 
just before the advent of the Republic.  Exam titles brought high 
status, but taking the traditional exams required huge investment in a 
form of "human capital" that was unsuitable to modern growth (Yuchtman 
2010). Did the end of the exam system result in a period of rapid social
 mobility with the rise of a new western-educated elite? And did the 
turmoil of the Communist era radically disrupt the old social order, and
 bring an entirely new class of people to positions of education, 
prosperity, and power? In particular was there a comeback of the old 
elites in the post-Mao era, 1978-2012?</div>

 find mortality rates increased during the country's early 
industrialization, with railroad access accounting for over five percent
 of average mortality between 1886 and 1893. Estimates from a

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14027_abstract">Civil
 service exam system, as one of the fundamental institutions of late 
imperial China, selected officials through exams. Is the exam "the 
ladder of success" for commoners, or no more than an elite reproduction 
of wealth and family background? The big question has been answered by 
several descriptive studies from a historical view, but only a few of 
them collect micro data and analyze it with the methods of statistics 
and econometrics. Our research can contribute in three aspects. First of
 all, we can replicate existing work by using a better dataset. Our 
sample includes 14112 jinshi and 3,234 officials from 52 exam years in 
Ming dynasty, from 1371 to 1610. Secondly, since existing work focuses 
on the Qing dynasty, our study will fill the research gap by using data 
from the Ming dynasty. Lastly, since our dataset covers more than 200 
years, we can study the change of social mobility in the long period, 
which will be a complement for current studies on intergenerational 
mobility in the long term. For further motivation, the question of the 
relationship between the civil service exam and social mobility can be 
also attached to other big issues. For example, the civil service exam 
may impact China's industrialization, by providing upward opportunity 
and attracting people away from studying science and technology. (Lin, 
1995)</div>

 an immense literature on Internet adoption and, to some extent, usage, 
there is still limited knowledge of how households consume information 
on the Internet.  In this paper, we intend to add to this knowledge at a
 very basic level, by measuring and classifying Internet information 
consumption along time and space.  Specifically, we aim to characterize 
household web surfing “types” according to the amount of time they spend
 online and how they distribute this time across different web domains. 
 We plan to define these types according to the following dimensions of 
Internet use (or subset thereof): Number of days online per week, total 
time online per week, time per domain, and concentration of domains 
visited according to time and views.   The last of these dimensions 
indicate whether a household’s visits across N domains are concentrated 
among just a few or more evenly spread across all N, as measured by time
 or visit frequency.   Using these dimensions to partition the usage 
space, examples of types that would emerge include the “tourist,” who 
infrequently visits a handful of sites for a relatively short period of 
time, and the “lingerer,” who spreads a great deal of time online across
 a few domains.</div>

 owners sometimes enter complementors’ product spaces to compete against
 them directly. Prior studies have offered two possible explanations for
 such entries: Platform owners may target the most successful 
complementors so as to appropriate value from their innovations, or they
 may target poor performing complementors to improve the platforms’ 
overall quality. Using data from Amazon.com, we analyze the patterns of 
Amazon’s entries into its third-party sellers’ product spaces. We find 
evidence consistent with the former explanation: that the likelihood of 
Amazon’s entry is positively correlated with the popularity and customer
 ratings of third-party sellers’ products. Amazon’s entry reduces the 
shipping costs of affected products and hence increases their demand. 
Results also show that third-party sellers affected by Amazon’s entry 
appear to be discouraged from growing their businesses on the platform

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14240_abstract">In
 the past decade, innovations in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal 
drilling have fueled a boom in the production of natural gas (as well as
 oil) from geological formations – primarily deep shales – in which 
hydrocarbon production was previously unprofitable. Impacts on U.S. 
fossil fuel production and the U.S. economy more broadly have been 
transformative, generating important benefits to consumers and producers
 alike. The widespread use of this new extractive technique also has 
great potential to expand the role of natural gas in U.S. energy 
markets, which presents an opportunity to curtail the use of coal, and 
thereby lower greenhouse gas emissions. Working against these benefits 
are concerns about negative externalities, including impacts to air and 
water associated with the chemicals used as injectants during the 
fracking process. In this paper, we discuss information on the role 
played by these injectants, their toxicity, and issues linked to 
“produced water,” which flows back from the well after the deposit is 
fracked. We find a pattern of more efficient use of water over time, 
which is likely to be broadly beneficial. On the other hand, we find a 
high correlation between the toxicity of reported injectants and the 
number of injectants whose identity is withheld under the “trade 
secrets” provision. The data allow us to separately evaluate the 
tendency to withhold information across the three major service firms 
(Baker-Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger). We find that Halliburton 
is the most secretive service firm and Baker-Hughes is the least 
secretive firm. In light of the impending acquisition of Baker-Hughes by
 Halliburton, this firm-specific information has particular implications
 for the likelihood of greater withholding going forward. One policy 
implication of our analysis is that benefits will accrue from slackening
 firms ability to withhold information concerning the ingredients used 
in the frack job.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14241_abstract">The
 evolution of energy production in the European Union (EU) is going 
through a big change in recent years: the incidence of traditional fuels
 is diminishing gradually for increasing renewable energy sources (RES),
 due to international concerns over climate change and for energy 
security reasons. The aim of this paper is to construct a simulation 
model that identifies and estimates costs that may arise for a community
 of negotiating countries from opportunistic behavior of some country 
when defining environmental policies. In this paper, the model is 
applied specifically to the new 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy 
Policies (COM(2014) 0015) (EC, 2014) on the promotion of RES that 
commits EU governments to a common goal to increase the share of RES in 
final consumption to 27% by 2030. Costs faced by EU countries to achieve
 the RES target are different due to their endowment heterogeneity, the 
availability of RES, the diffusion process of cost improvements and the 
different instruments to support the development of the RES 
technologies. Given the still undefined participation agreement to reach
 the new overall RES target by 2030, we want to assess the potential 
cost penalty induced by free riding behavior. This could stem from some 
EU country, which avoids complying with the RES Directive. Our policy 
simulation exercise shows that costs increase more that proportionally 
with the non-participating country size, measured with GDP and CO2 
emissions. Furthermore, we provide a model to analytically assess the 
likelihood each EU country may have to behave opportunistically within 
the negotiation process of the new proposal on EU RES targets (COM(2014)
 0015).</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14242_abstract">Negotiations
 for oil and natural gas leases are a crucial part of the energy 
industry. There have been many theoretical models of what should happen 
in these negotiations (see, for example, Summers 1925, King 1948, Lowe 
1985, Hinton 1985, and Hendricks et al. 1993). There is, however, almost
 no empirical information about what the results of the negotiations 
are, and what factors drive the conclusions to negotiations. One reason 
for this empirical gap is that oil and gas leases have until recently 
existed only in paper form and were housed in respective counties’ 
courthouses. This made it very difficult to aggregate and extract useful
 information. Recent efforts to digitize leases, however, have enabled 
researchers to engage in a thorough and systematic analysis of 
lease-related questions, aided by innovations in algorithmic data 
reading techniques and textual analysis methods (see, for example, 
Moszoro et al., 2014), as well as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 
mapping capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this study we use a dataset of approximately 100,000 oil and gas 
lease contracts in Tarrant County, Texas, between 2007 and 2011 along 
with information contained in geological maps of the relevant geographic
 region, and associated drilling and production records kept by the 
Texas Railroad Commission to examine the economics of contracting in the
 U.S. oil and gas industry. In particular, we are interested in to what 
extent learning leads to changes in lease terms and associated 
inter-temporal changes in distribution of rents from mineral 
development. Results are forthcoming.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14243_abstract">This
 work applies stochastic dynamic programming methods to a small 
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to investigate near-term 
electricity investment decisions under uncertainty in future technology 
costs and policy. Most studies that include technological learning 
utilize deterministic learning curves in which a given amount of 
investment, production or capacity leads to a given cost reduction. We 
investigate technological learning in a stochastic framework in which a 
given amount of capacity investment changes the 'probabilities' of 
future technology costs.

Results show that without technological learning, cost uncertainty has a
 weak or no impact on optimal near-term investment strategy for the 
scenarios explored. However, cost uncertainty with stochastic 
technological learning can have a significant impact. Depending on the 
rate of technological learning, as well as the expectations about future
 policy, the value of reducing expected future costs can provide strong 
motivation for additional non-carbon investment in the near-term. If 
technological learning is deterministic instead of stochastic, less 
non-carbon investment is optimal in the near-term.

As the learning rate increases, more non-carbon investment is optimal in
 the near-term. With higher learning rates, near-term non-carbon 
investments are more valuable as they impact probabilities of future 
costs more and result in larger reductions in expected cost. Learning 
rates lower than those found in the literature can lead to significant 
additional near-term investment in non-carbon technology being optimal 
in order to lower expected future cost of technology.

In a realistic industry structure with competition, and assuming 
technological learning benefits spillover to competitors or are not 
fully captured by the private sector investors, there may be 
underinvestment in non-carbon technologies compared to what is socially 
optimal. Government policy may be needed to encourage private investment
 in non-carbon technologies to help lower expected cost of those 
technologies in the future.</div>

 article is aimed at creating a theoretical foundation for the debates 
between neoliberalism and feminist critique of the gender blindness of 
austerity measures chosen by Canadian government to mitigate the affect 
of the Global Crisis of 2008-2009[i] on women workers. Feminist economic
 theory contributes to understanding the long-run effects of the Great 
Depression of 2008 on well-being of male and female workers[ii]and moves
 heterodox macroeconomic studies from examining income and employment 
effects[iii] to a different level, i.e. disaggregating these effects by 
gender and also “frames the issue in a broader conception of well-being 
and nonmarket dimensions of the economy.”[iv]Following feminist and 
heterodox economists, it is possible to underline that the costs of 
spending cuts will be reflected by worker’s weaker health, more 
expensive education, and lack of other welfare programs in the medium 
run that will also impact future generations of workers in the long run.
There is no much analysis of the Canadian federal government policy 
overall and in particular from heterodox and feminist economic 
perspective. I would like to make a pitch for more embedded feminist 
economic analysis of the government policies in Canada in order to 
understand the approach of Canadian federal government for economic 
policy formulation prior and post Great Depression of 2008. I would like
 to bring a big frame of analysis – not just focusing on policy 
documents, but understand the policy through the lens of feminist and 
heterodox economic thought.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14107_abstract">Several
 scholars have addressed the narrative of a two-stage European crisis. 
In a first stage, the “he-cession”, men would have been hit the most by 
the economic recession. Shortly thereafter, in the “she-austerity” 
stage, women would have suffered the heaviest burdens of the fiscal 
retrenchment measures. If that were the case, the policy response to the
 crisis would be producing an increase in the – already high 
pre-existing – gender inequality.
In this work we analyse the European Union Statistics on Income and 
Living Conditions (EU-SILC) micro-data, covering 620,017 households in 
27 EU countries for three years (2007, 2010, 2013). Building on a 
Classical political economy approach, we aim to explore the link between
 households’ sources of income (rents, profits, wages and State 
transfers) and income changes during the crisis. As it turns out, the 
crisis and the policy response to it have impoverished several European 
households and increased income inequality in Europe. However, there is 
no strong evidence to support or reject the abovementioned narrative on 
the gendered impact of the crisis yet. Thus, it may be necessary to wait
 for further evidence before taking the two-stage narrative for granted,
 while stronger emphasis on pre-existing structural gender equality may 
be warranted.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14109_abstract">Using
 data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Surveys, this study examines 
whether and the extent to which the gendered impact of the 2007-9 
recession on time use of married co-habiting mothers and fathers varied 
by socioeconomic status. Recent findings in the literature show that the
 recession widened the gender difference in total (paid and unpaid) work
 hours of married co-habiting mothers and fathers. We examine whether 
and to the extent which these results varied by socioeconomic status 
(parents’ education and household income levels). Given the previous 
findings in the literature that the gender difference in the time spent 
on housework is smaller among highly educated women and men, and women 
in poor households but not men, spend more time doing unpaid work, we 
expect the burden of the recession to be distributed more gender 
equitably among mothers and fathers with high socioeconomic status. In 
other words, we expect that mothers in low socioeconomic status 
households to be not only hit harder by the recession but also to have 
shouldered disproportionate burden of household adjustment during the 
crisis.</div>

prices? Who in the income distribution gains from the potential changes in home prices? This paper&lt;br /&gt;
uses the monetary policy intervention between July 2000 and December 2001 that preceded the&lt;br /&gt;
housing boom to study these two questions. Employing a novel identification strategy that separates&lt;br /&gt;
small neighborhoods based on an incidental distribution of the county population around&lt;br /&gt;
pre-determined neighborhood affordability thresholds, the paper shows that, between July 2000&lt;br /&gt;
and December 2001, a homeowner in the lowest income quintile experienced an increase of approximately&lt;br /&gt;
7% in housing wealth, while a homeowner in the highest income quintile experienced&lt;br /&gt;
no change in housing wealth. Moreover, between December 2004 and December 2005, a period&lt;br /&gt;
of contractionary monetary policy but high intensity of subprime lending, the effect in all income&lt;br /&gt;
quintiles is zero. By construction of the empirical design, the monetary transmission mechanism&lt;br /&gt;

 this paper, we document that mortgage-backed securities (MBS) held by 
the Federal Reserve exhibit faster principal prepayment rates than MBS 
held by the rest of the market. Next,
we show that this stylized fact persists even when controlling for 
factors that affect prepayment behavior, and thus determine the MBS that
 are delivered to the Federal Reserve. After ruling out several 
potential explanations for this result, we provide evidence that points 
to an agency problem in the secondary market for MBS, which has not 
previously been documented, as the most likely explanation for the 
abnormal prepayment behavior of Federal Reserve-held MBS. This agency 
problem|a key feature of the MBS market|arises when originators of 
mortgages that underlie the MBS no longer share in the prepayment risk 
of the securities, thereby increasing incentives to solicit refinancing 
activity. Therefore, Federal Reserve MBS holdings acquired from 
originators as a result of large-scale asset purchases can help 
stimulate economic activity through a so-called "solicited refinancing 
channel." Finally, we provide an estimate of the additional refinancing 
activity resulting from the solicited refinancing channel in the years 
after the Federal Reserve's first MBS purchase program, demonstrating 
that this channel conveyed savings on monthly mortgage payments to 
homeowners.</div>

the United States interacted in driving the run-up (and subsequent decline) in US housing

we focus on the history of interstate-banking deregulation during the 1980s, i.e. prior to the
large net capital inflows into the US from China and other emerging economies. Our results
suggest a long shadow of deregulation: in states that opened their banking markets to
out-of-state banks earlier, house prices were more sensitive to capital inflows. We provide
evidence that global imbalances were a major positive funding shock for US wide banks:
different from local banks, these banks held a geographically diversified portfolio of mortgages
which allowed them to tap the global demand for safe assets by issuing private-label
safe assets backed by the country-wide US housing market. This, in turn, allowed them to
expand mortgage lending and lower interest rates, driving up housing prices.</div>

real house prices, price-to-income, and price-to-rent ratios— for a sample of 22 countries (including the
U.S.) during the period 1975Q1-2013Q2 for evidence of explosive behavior underlying the booms and
busts in housing. The detection of explosive behavior in the time series of house prices provides a
timeline as well as empirical content to the narrative connecting the evolution of housing markets to
the global recession— our rich cross-country dataset offers a novel international perspective. For testing
and detection, we adopt techniques based on a right-tail variation of the standard Augmented Dickey-
Fuller (ADF) test— the supremum ADF (SADF) (Phillips et al. (2011)) and the generalized SADF
(GSADF) (Phillips et al. (2012) and Phillips et al. (ming))— where the alternative hypothesis is of a
mildly explosive process (even periodically collapsing with the GSADF test) behavior within sample.
We propose a novel approach to apply these techniques to panel data. Statistically significant periods
of exuberance are found in most countries, with our panel estimates suggesting an unprecedented period
of mildly explosive behavior that became widespread across countries preceding the 2008 </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14205_abstract">As
 compared to other methods such as mathematical modeling, regression, 
laboratory and field experimentation, the ‘method of imaginary 
constructs’ — or thought experimentation — is employed rather rarely in 
economics, certainly in contemporary ‘mainstream economics’. The aim of 
this paper is to examine two instances of this rare species and use them
 to cast a light on different ways of economic theorizing. While both 
thought experiments purport to explain the origin of money, they do so 
in dramatically different ways. Certainly the nature and function of 
money are understood very differently. More importantly, money appears 
as an unintended consequence and separate from most other central 
socio-economic phenomena with the exception of exchange in one, but as a
 deliberate invention and closely connected to phenomena such as 
freedom, property, debt, interest rates, and innovation in the other. It
 is no accident, then, that contemporary ‘mainstream economics’, which 
essentially accepts the results of the former thought experiment, has 
separate explanations for all of these. I will argue that to the extent 
that we want good scientific theories to reduce the number of 
independent phenomena, the latter thought experiment is more successful 
in helping to establish a good scientific theory.</div>

 contemporary mainstream economics, everything is a model, or so it 
would appear. There are many kinds of models, theoretical, empirical, 
econometric, material, game theoretic, behavioral, stochastic, and so 
forth. There are also many kinds of experiments in economics: 
laboratory, field, natural, quasi, and accidental. There are also rare 
appeals to thought experiments (TEs), and some that were clear 
candidates before the term was coined, especially in the early modern 
period.

If the puzzle about TEs stems from the belief that we can learn 
something new about the world just by engaging a train of thought 
without appealing to any new empirical findings, then economics seems a 
promising candidate. As the early neoclassical economists emphasized, 
economics is a science of the mind. The way that we know and understand 
the pathway of economic agency is by introspection on the supposition 
that we can extrapolate from our own deliberations to other minds.

This paper will demarcate TEs from models in economics, and argue that 
TEs and models are distinct types of conceptual tools. They differ more 
by degree than by kind, and fall on a continuum. There are some models 
that are near cousins to thought experiments, and vice versa. I will 
argue that thought experiments are in fact quite rare in economics, past
 or present. They are launched by a strong if not jarring counterfactual
 to a distant rather than proximate other world, and the journey the 
mind then takes back to this world is a familiar one. The paradigmatic 
case is Hume’s sudden doubling of the money supply, or Friedman’s 
helicopter drop. But the current rash of TEs in environmental economics,
 as posited by for example Weitzman or Keohane, is a misnomer. We would 
be the better for finding a different name for models that speculate 
well into the future.</div>

			 <a style="font-size:12px;" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2016conference/program/retrieve.php?pdfid=411" target="_blank">[Download Preview]</a> 			<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14207_abstract">In
 a 1978 JEL article, Paul Samuelson wrote of Malthus and other classical
 economists that they “lived during the industrial revolution, but 
scarcely looked out from their libraries to notice the remaking of the 
world.” Yet it was Samuelson himself who was faulted by Daniel Hausman 
and the late Terence Hutchison for scorning the ‘hard work of the social
 scientist” and contriving elegant mathematical models without any real 
world correlates. They appear to be as guilty as Malthus for not looking
 out of the window and for theorizing the world from the armchair. 
“Armchair theorizing” is, of course, a pejorative metaphor for a 
practice in which economists seem to be unconcerned with “data” and 
“evidence”, whether statistical or otherwise, and yet make claims about 
the world.&lt;br /&gt;
This paper will reconsider Hausman’s assessment of Samuelson’s 1958 JPE 
article An Exact Consumption-Loan Model. My argument is that Samuelson’s
 modelling exercise should not be considered as capable of being tested 
against statistical data. Rather, Samuelson performed a thought 
experiment that tested a generic intuition held by the economics 
profession, that markets are capable of serving the common good, without
 this being the individual agents’ intention. Just as in the case of 
Malthus, Samuelson’s thought experiment serves to debunk utopian 
thinking that fails to specify the productive mechanisms of its ideal 
state.&lt;br /&gt;
I argue that it is exactly such debunking exercises that belong to the 
province of the social scientists, including the economists. As Margaret
 Schabas notes, in contrast with models that have a representational 
function, thought experiments challenge “deep-rooted” intuitions about 
the world. Such a strategy serves the role Thomas Kuhn attributed to 
thought experiments: to change our worldview by pinpointing the 
paradoxical nature of our present ontological commitments. Because 
Hausman misconceived Samuelson’s modelling exercise as representational,
 he failed to thresh out this important message.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14208_abstract">In
 economics, the methodological value of thought experiments is 
frequently justified by referring to the difficulty of conducting 
controlled experiments. It has also been argued that thought experiments
 serve other functions in economics, such as establishing causal facts, 
isolating tendencies, justifying social institutions and their 
persistence, or bridging the gap between mathematical models and 
reality. In this paper, I argue that thought experiments have yet 
another function in economics. In the case of econometric modeling, 
thought experiments have been employed to bridge the gap between 
theoretically established relationships and the process of empirical 
testing. More specifically, thought experiments have served to explicate
 and operationalize some of the entities in the theory so as to 
facilitate the next state of empirical tests.&lt;br /&gt;
In support of my argument, I will offer a historical case study, namely 
the “hypothetical experiments” of the Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch.
 As I will show, Frisch used thought experiments to justify his axioms 
of consumer choice theory in his paper Sur un Problème d’Economie Pure, 
as well as in a series of lectures of the early 1930s. Frisch aimed at 
eliminating introspection and subjective utility, vestiges of the 
Austrian school. At the same time, he sought to equip economic theories 
with acceptable behavioral foundations from which quantitative economic 
reasoning could be derived. In so doing, Frisch followed in the 
tradition of Fisher and Pareto. While impressed by their developments of
 utility analysis, Frisch aimed at taking one step further towards 
freeing consumer choice theory from psychological concepts, such as 
utility, while nevertheless arriving at quantitative measurements of 
utility. Towards this end, Frisch used thought experiments to justify 
the set of choice axioms he introduced into consumer choice theory. 
Thereby, Frisch circumvented the problem of directly observing utility 
via actual experiments without purging the concept of utility from 
economic altogether.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14332_abstract">How
 do people think about fairness in settings with uncertainty? One view 
holds that fairness requires equality of opportunity; another holds that
 it requires equality of outcomes. Relative to the resolution of 
uncertainty, the first view takes an ex ante perspective, while the 
second takes an ex post perspective. In this paper, we conduct a 
laboratory experiment designed to determine which perspective people 
adopt, and under what conditions. We find that most people view fairness
 from an ex ante perspective when making decisions ex ante, and from an 
ex post perspective when making decisions ex post. As a result, they 
exhibit the hallmark of time-inconsistency: after making an initial plan
 (ex ante all uncertainty) that is fully state-contingent, they revise 
it upon learning that certain states will not occur (that is, ex post 
the resolution of some uncertainty, and ex ante the resolution of 
residual uncertainty). These patterns are robust and persist even when 
people are aware of their proclivities. Indeed, subjects who switch from
 ex ante fair to ex post fair choices, and who are aware of this 
proclivity, generally avoid precommitments and intentionally retain the 
flexibility to manifest time inconsistency.</div>

caused by optimizing households, or is (seemingly) optimal behavior 
caused by planners who paternalistically manipulate households that 
would not optimize on their own? We show that widely studied optimality

of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. It explores the various methodological
issues, the measurement problems, the data availability, and the robustness of results
relating to disparities in arrests, incarceration and post-prison recidivism. Partly relevant
in the review are the various assertions made about the consequences of criminal justice
involvement, particularly for labor market participation and family formation. Also discussed
is the literature about criminal justice involvement and such factors as the returns to early
childhood education and the effects of schoo scipline policies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14172_abstract">Health can have both direct and indirect effects on labor market outcomes (e.g., the ability
to obtain employment, maintain employment, and earn a living), which can lead to an even
greater decline in the quality of life for the individual affected and any dependent family
members. Therefore, this study investigates the link between incarceration and health over
the life course using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Theory and prior
research suggests an ambiguous relationship between health and incarceration. On the
one hand, incarceration may increase exposure to certain communicable diseases, and
may lead to chronic illnesses related to poor living conditions and stress. On the other
hand, incarceration may provide protective benefits to the individual incarcerated (e.g.,
decreases in mortality due to homicide, accidental death, etc.), and it may offer opportunities
to make health investments through greater access to health care. The relationship between
incarceration and health is further confounded by endogeneity, resulting from the fact that
the incarcerated population is highly selected. Various causal inference techniques are used
in this analysis to disentangle the relationship between health and incarceration.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13948_abstract">Research
 has shown that, at the principles level, economic education relies 
mainly on exams for assessment.  Introducing differentiated assessment 
in economic education through active learning provides a way for 
economic educators to increase the level of learning and to assess a 
higher level of understanding.  In this paper, we provide instructors 
with low-cost active learning assignments.  These assignments rely on 
creative art projects and require students to create economic content by
 first determining necessary information, then organizing their thoughts
 and finally using economic language clearly and precisely.  We believe 
that these assignments better assess deeper levels of learning and we 
advocate for using the active learning assignments in conjunction with 
traditional testing.  Multiple instruments of assessment and learning 
provide a more inclusive educational environment for today's students.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13949_abstract">Recent
 policies, research, and debates have targeted the effectiveness of 
financial incentives in affecting teacher behavior and student learning 
outcomes.  In addition to The United Stated Department of Education's 
funding of financial incentives via the Teacher Incentive Fund, 
financial incentive-based reform efforts are being designe, implemented,
 and studied in England, Australia, India, Chile, Mexico, Israel, and 
Portugal.  Political, legal, and educational leaders have the greatest 
access to the financial incentives necessary to provide extrinsic 
motivation for educators' compliance with reform efforts.  Although 
current research indicates teacher autonomy is positively correlated 
with student achievement, studies are often unable to quantify teachers'
 autonomous and nuanced implementation of reform efforts.

This artifactual field experiment employs experimental economics 
methodology to explore teachers' individual, autonomous responses to 
student diagnostic information and financial incentives tied to student 
achievement and growth.  This study was conducted with a sample of 
pre-service teachers at a large public university in the northeastern 
United States.  We employ hierarchical logistic and zero-inflated 
Poisson regressions to model teachers' allocation of individualized 
instructional time based on the availability of diagnostic information 
and financial incentives.  Early findings suggest teachers behave 
strategically, allocating time to students for whom the monetary return 
per hour is greatest.  Expansion of this framework will further develop 
researchers' ability to quantify teachers' autonomous and nuanced 
interpretation, integration, and implementation of reform efforts.</div>

students enrolled in four introductory microeconomics classes during the
 spring semesters of 2007 and 2009 to examine the effects of prior exam 
performance on increments for current in- and out-of-classroom efforts 
toward future exams.  We found that students' prior exam performance is 
an important and significant signal of students' decisions to invest 
more or fewer efforts on the next exam.  These findings also indirectly 
imply that many students behave like producers in evaluating their 
previous production outcomes and then deciding on a level of effort to 
invest in current production.  In addition, we found that weaker 
students relative to stronger students invest lower effort when they 
received poor exam grades.  Comparing weaker students with stronger 
students, weaker students are more likely to behave like producers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13951_abstract">It
 is important to acknowledge that all individuals live in an economic 
world and have developed theories about how that world works.  These 
naive theories can be problematic for learning when information 
presented by a teacher is not consistent with a student's naive theory. 
 When these inconsistencies occur, it is likely the student will discard
 the new information, never revising her theory, and therefore never 
developing an"expert" theory of the economic world.  We can overcome 
this stumbling block by acknowledging students' naive theories about 
economics and addressing their theories within instruction.&lt;br 
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An important first step in this process is understanding how students 
conceptualize the economic world; in other words, "what do students' 
naive theories about the economic world look like?"  This is a relevant 
question at all levels of economic education, elementary through 
post-secondary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this mixed methods study is to investigate the 
similarities and differences in observed behavior and stated preferences
 among children, novice adults, and economics experts in a common pool 
resources game using quantitative data and qualitative data from 
semi-structured interviews, which are combined in a binary logistic 
model to predict participants' choices to either play the game or take 
an allocation of a resource.  Consistent with the literature, males were
 more likely to play the game and females more likely to take the 
allocation.  Children were more likely to play the game than novice 
adults but not more likely to play the game than than expert adults.</div>

 the past fifty-pus years, Stanley and Janice Berenstain published 403 
board books, chapter books, and early readers about a lovable family of 
bears called the Berenstain Bears.  With so many Berenstain Bears titles
 available, and the popular pedagogical practice of teaching economics 
through children's literature, one would believe that a host of economic
 education resources utilizing this popular series exists.  This is not 
the case, and I conjecture it is due to a lack of documented economic 
concepts covered in the popular children's books.  Thus, this research 
seeks to provide such a list, along with discussion of the prevalent 
concepts found, background information on the Berenstains, and a 
discussion of the importance of cultivating interest and motivation in 
economics, specifically via the use of children's literature.  To date, I
 have examined 46 of the Berenstain Bears titles and found economic 
and/or personal finance topics in 31, or 67%, of the titles.  I

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14131_abstract">This
 paper studies the effect of finance on the growth and stability of 
income of the bottom forty percent of the income distribution (B40). It 
does so along three dimensions: financial stability, efficiency, and 
access to the use of various financial services. We control for other 
potential drivers of the B40 income growth using well ¬established 
control variables from the literature including the initial income 
level, education, investment, macroeconomic stability, size of the 
government, trade openness, quality of institutions, and other factors. 
To derive and estimate a parsimonious regression model, we use the LASSO
 variable selection approach. To triangulate the obtained estimation 
results for B40 income, we estimate analogous regression models for the 
top 60 (T60) and aggregate income (GDP). The triangulation shall give us
 some insight into how finance affects B40 income directly and 
indirectly, and help us address some of the concerns about data 
noisiness and comparability from household surveys.</div>

 paper develops new estimates of export quality, far more extensive than

particularly rapid during the early stages of development, with the 
process largely completed as a country reaches upper middle-income 
status. There is significant cross-country heterogeneity in the growth 
rate of quality. Within any given product line, quality converges over 
time to the world frontier. Institutional quality, liberal trade 
policies, FDI inflows, and human capital all promote quality upgrading, 
although their impact varies across sectors. The results suggest that 
reducing barriers to entry into new sectors can allow economies to

 developing countries move to higher levels of production one would 
expect that the product mix would contain more goods (and services as 
well) which require the adoption of newer technologies. This process is 
reflected in higher capital-output ratios. If we use per-capita income 
as a proxy for development and the change in the incremental 
capital-output ratio (ICOR) as a measure of capital intensity, we can 
simulate long-term trends in GDP by changing a country's ICOR to the 
norms of other countries which have reached that level of development. 
We assume that the change occurs when the country's potential GDP

 article reviews approaches to voluntary nutrition labeling (VNL), such 
as front-of-package (FOP) labels, that emerged in the 2001-2014 period 
to provide simplified nutrition information, thus lowering the search 
cost for nutritional information. We present a market model to assess 
consumer and producer responses to changes in information search cost 
brought about by VNL. We specifically focus on the introduction of VNL 
in the ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) market and illustrate trends in 
labeling and the overall healthfulness of RTEC products. Both the 
conceptual and empirical evidence suggest that VNL has been instrumental
 in attaining a healthier RTEC market. Finally, we suggest a research 
agenda to further theory development and empirical (experimental and big
 data) research to better comprehend the role of VNL in relation to 
market healthfulness. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14363_abstract">The
 overarching goal of nutrition labeling is to transform intrinsic 
credence attributes into searchable cues, which would enable consumers 
to make informed food choices at lower search costs. We determine to 
what extent the usage of nutrition label information in food purchase 
decisions affects household meal planner’s stated concerns and 
perceptions regarding their (and their household’s) future general 
health and obesity status. The empirical analysis employs a largescale 
representative survey data set and propensity score matching (PSM) 
estimators (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). We explicitly address our 
objectives in the context of potential reverse causality and 
self-selection bias associated with direct comparisons of stated 
concerns between label users and non-users. We use alternative PSM 
algorithms to estimate robust treatment effects regarding the impact of 
label usage on food-health concerns, when treatment is endogenous to the
 outcome. Our results support the common notion that consumer 
food-health concerns and related information behavior are linked, but 
not in straightforward manner. Dominant subjective food attributes, such
 as taste, convenience and affordability, may in fact outweigh the 
benefits of information about healthier, alternative food choices. In 
order to change dietary health behavior, food manufacturer and policy 
makers alike need to adopt communication instruments that better account
 for differences in preferences, shopping habits, and overall usage 
patterns of nutrition labeling information.</div>

 motivation to pay a premium for socially responsible products is partly
 an expression of consumer concern for the well-being of those involved 
in the production process. Thus, choosing to buy a product with a 
socially responsible label and choosing to donate to a charity are 
similarly motivated actions. While there is an extensive literature on 
the economics of charitable giving that examines motivations to donate 
as well as on the impacts of labeling on consumer demand, there is very 
little overlap between the two literatures. In this paper we attempt to 
bridge these two literatures by investigating whether consumers have 
heterogeneous motivations for paying a premium. We design a lab 
experiment that auctions coffee with hypothetical socially responsible 
labels that put different weights on in-kind vs. cash transfers. We find
 that those consumers who prefer to restrict most of the premium to be 
an in-kind transfer (and are classified as paternalistic altruists) are 
willing to pay a 52.5% price premium over standard coffee. Those who 
prefer that most of the premium is paid as cash to the recipient (strong
 altruists) are willing to pay a 42.5% premium. Finally, those who are 
indifferent to how the premium is spent by the recipient (warm-glow 
givers) are willing to pay only a 19.2% premium. We discuss the 
implications of our results and future research directions. </div>

 develop a quantitative theory of business cycles with coordination 
failures. As firms seek to coordinate production because of a demand 
externality, multiple equilibria arise. We use a global game approach to
 select a unique equilibrium that exhibits two steady states. After a 
large temporary shock, coordination may fail pushing the economy in a 
quasi-permanent recession. Our calibrated model accounts for features of
 the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath. Government spending, while 
generally harmful, can increase welfare when the economy is about to 
transition to the bad steady state. Simple subsidies implement the 
efficient allocation.</div>

 cycles play very little role in the modern theory of business cycles. 
In this paper we present a general structure, a particular model and a 
DSGE extension with the hope of giving new life to this mostly dismissed
 view of fluctuations. In particular, we begin by showing why models 
with demand complementarities, which are quite ubiquitous in 
macroeconomics, can give rise to limit cycle under rather simple 
conditions.  The key elements that induce limit cycles are the presence 
of a demand complementarity related to an accumulable good and that the 
demand complementarities be locally strong but globally limited. We then
 present a fully specified model dynamic equilibrium model where 
unemployment risk and precautionary savings interact to induce a limit 
cycle driven by the type of forces outlined in our general structure. In
 this model, the economy goes through expansion periods where agents 
accumulate durable goods and/or housing more quickly when unemployment 
is low because borrowing is perceived as being less risky. Subsequently 
the economy goes though a recession phase when agents pull back on their
 purchases because unemployment increases thereby causing borrowing to 
become more risky. While this process is shown to be recurring and 
compatible with rational expectation, it does not involve any 
indeterminacy: fundamentals fully pin-down equilibrium behavior. We then
 show that in macroeconomic U.S. data, there is nontrivial variability 
at frequencies which are lower than the ones traditionally looked at by 
the business cycle literature, that could well be interpreted as a 
medium frequency limit cycle perturbed with shocks. We complete the 
analysis by showing how a DSGE version of our model can be estimated   
to have a limit cycle, and how it can shed new light on interesting 
features of the data once it is augmented to include some randomness.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12346_abstract">In
 U.S. data 1981-2012, unsecured firm credit moves procyclically and 
tends to lead GDP, while secured firm credit is acyclical; similarly, 
shocks to unsecured firm credit explain a far larger fraction of output 
fluctuations than shocks to secured credit. In this paper we develop a 
tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which unsecured firm 
credit arises from self-enforcing borrowing constraints, preventing an 
efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit
 rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation 
which is a forward-looking variable. We argue that self-fulfilling 
beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously 
persistent business cycle dynamics. A dynamic complementarity between 
current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated sunspot shocks 
to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both 
secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity and output. We show that
 these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for 
around half of output volatility.</div>

 can happen to unemployment after a severe disruption of the labor 
market? Standard models predict a reversion to a long-run steady state. 
By contrast, this paper shows that a large shock may set the economy on a
 path towards a different steady state with possibly extreme 
unemployment. This result follows from the empirical behavior of the 
U.S. job finding rate over the last 25 years. First, I estimate a 
reduced-form model for the labor market and show that –once allowing for
 nonlinearities– it implies a stable steady state around 5 percent 
unemployment and an unstable one around 10 percent unemployment. Second,
 I consider an extension of a basic Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) 
model in which multiple steady states arise due to skill losses upon 
unemployment, following Pissarides(1992). Based on only observed rates 
of job loss, this model endogenously explains most of the observed 
fluctuations in the job finding rate and the unemployment rate, thereby 
dramatically improving over a basic DMP model with a single steady 
state.</div>

 impact of economic shocks and proximity to war in the Eastern Ukraine 
on social capital in Russian regions. We proxy social capital by the 
number of internet searches for the most salient dimensions of 
pro-social behavior such as “donate blood”, “orphanage”, “charity”, 
“adopt a child” and other. Controlling for other socio-economic 
characteristics, the principal component of the number of such searches 
is correlated with survey-based measures of generalized social trust. We
 find that social capital measured through the number of such searches 
responds negatively to the spikes of inflation and decreases in real 
income. It is also positively correlated with the intensity of the 
conflict in East Ukraine. Our identification strategy is based on the 
difference-in-differences approach where we interact the weekly measures
 of the conflict intensity with the distance to the conflict zone – 
controlling for region and week fixed effects.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21665_abstract">Using
 the data on billionaires and their wealth collected 
by&nbsp;Forbes&nbsp;since the 1990s, as well as 
the&nbsp;Ekspert.ru&nbsp;database on Russia’s largest enterprises, I 
establish some facts about the super-wealthy in Russia and how they 
compare to their counterparts elsewhere. Contrary to conventional 
wisdom, the greatest concentration of billionaires is not in the oil and
 gas sector but in metals production. The largest increase in the number
 of the super-wealthy and in their assets occurred not in the 1990s or 
the early 2000s but between 2005 and 2008. Unlike in Brazil, where 
despite the global financial crisis the total wealth of billionaires 
nearly tripled after 2008, the wealth of Russia’s billionaires fell by 
29 percent in this period, and had decreased even before the imposition 
of Western sanctions. The paper examines the volatility of extreme 
wealth in Russia, comparing it to that in China, India, Brazil and other
 emerging economies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10403_abstract">One
 explanation for overpricing on asset markets is a lack of self-control 
abilities among traders. Self-control is the individual capacity to 
override or inhibit undesired behavioral tendencies such as impulses, 
and to refrain from acting on them. We implement the first experiment 
that is able to address a potential causal relationship between 
self-control abilities and systematic overpricing on financial markets 
by introducing an exogenous variation of selfcontrol abilities. 
Moreover, our experimental treatments seek to detect some of the 
channels through which individual self-control problems could transmit 
into irrational exuberance on the aggregate level. We observe a strong 
and causal effect of self-control abilities on market
overpricing. Low self-control traders are associated with significantly 
larger levels of overpricing, and they earn significantly less on 
exuberant markets as a consequence of holding assets for too long.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11702_abstract">We
 build on social psychology theory that implies individuals draw on more
 cognitive, less emotional thought processes when engaging in activities
 separated by time, space, or social distance from the here and now. 
Specifically, we examine whether individuals are less vulnerable to the 
influence of emotions on their financial decisions when deciding for 
others versus themselves. We find individuals are less vulnerable to the
 influence of emotions as an increasing function of the social distance 
between the decision maker and the decision target. Individuals were 
significantly more risk-seeking and discounted future rewards more when 
investing on behalf of themselves than for a family member, co-worker, 
or client. The findings are robust to use of both hypothetical and 
incentive-compatible tasks and are evident based on both 
between-subjects and within-subjects designs. In Study 1, individuals 
made investment decisions on behalf of themselves, a family member, or a
 co-worker. Risk-seeking differed across the conditions, and tests 
indicated that participants making a choice for themselves were 
significantly more risk-seeking than participants deciding for a family 
member or co-worker. In Study 2, participants made choices between 
smaller-sooner rewards and larger-later rewards for themselves, a family
 member, and a co-worker (within-subjects). Participants discounted 
future rewards significantly more for self than for a family member or 
co-worker. In Studies 3a and 3b, participants made choices for rewards 
that were incentive compatible rather than hypothetical. We employed a 
within-subjects design where participants made choices for rewards that 
would accrue to themselves, a family member, a co-worker, or a client. 
Participants chose fewer larger-later rewards for themselves than they 
did for the family member, co-worker, and client. These findings have 
implications for the investment management industry, policy makers, and 
individuals saving for retirement, all of which often involve situations
 in which decision-makers make choices for themselves or others.</div>

 find consistent evidence of negative autocorrelation in decision-making
 that is unrelated to the merits of the cases considered in three 
separate high-stakes field settings: refugee asylum court decisions, 
loan application reviews, and major league baseball umpire pitch calls. 
The evidence is most consistent with the law of small numbers and the 
gambler’s fallacy – people underestimating the likelihood of sequential 
streaks occurring by chance – leading to negatively autocorrelated 
decisions that result in errors. The negative autocorrelation is 
stronger among more moderate and less experienced decision-makers, 
following longer streaks of decisions in one direction, when the current
 and previous cases share similar characteristics or occur close in 
time, and when decision-makers face weaker incentives for accuracy. 
Other explanations for negatively autocorrelated decisions such as 
quotas, learning, or preferences to treat all parties fairly, are less 
consistent with the evidence, though we cannot completely rule out 
sequential contrast effects as an alternative explanation.</div>

 use insurance claims data for more than 88 million individuals with 
employer sponsored insurance in the United States to analyze the 
variation in health care spending for the privately insured.  Our data 
includes the transaction prices that private insurers negotiate with 
health care providers for care at the claims level.  This allows us to 
analyze the variation in health care providers’ prices within and across
 markets and determine the role that prices play in driving spending 
variation for the privately insured.  This work has four key findings.  
First, there the between total spending per beneficiaries on Medicare 
recipients and total spending per beneficiary on the privately insured 
is 14.0%.  Second, we find that the quantity of care provided and the 
price of care provided each account for approximately half of the 
spending variation among the privately insured.  Third, we then document
 expansive variation in the providers’ private-payer prices within and 
across markets.  Across the nation, hospitals’ inpatient private-payer 
prices vary by over a factor of 10.  Within markets, on average, two 
hospitals drawn at random have a difference in average inpatient price 
that is 42% of the mean price within that market.  Fourth, we find that 
higher hospital market power, greater adoption of technology, and being 
ranked as a top performing hospital by the US News and World Report are 
all associated with high prices.</div>

premium setting, hospital-insurer bargaining, household demand for insurance, and individual
demand for hospitals. Increased insurer competition may lead to lower premiums; it may also
increase health providers' leverage to negotiate higher prices, thereby mitigating premium reductions.
We use detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data from a large benefits
manager to estimate our model and simulate the removal of an insurer from consumers' choice
sets. Although premiums rise and annual consumer surplus falls by $50-120 per capita, hospital
prices and spending fall in certain markets as remaining insurers negotiate lower rates. Overall,
the impact on negotiated prices is heterogeneous, with increases or decreases of up to 15% across
markets. We conclude that insurer competition can increase consumer surplus but also generate
a redistribution of rents across hospitals and greater medical spending in certain markets.</div>

 consumer responsiveness to medical care prices is a central issue in 
health economics and a key ingredient in the optimal design and 
regulation of health insurance markets. We study consumer price 
responsiveness to medical care prices, leveraging a natural experiment 
that occurred at a large self-insured firm which forced all of its 
employees to switch from an insurance plan that provided free health 
care to a non-linear high deductible insurance plan with markedly higher
 cost sharing. We find that the switch caused a 16.45% reduction in 
total yearly medical expenditures at the firm, leading to approximately 
$123 million less medical spending per year. We break down this total 
spending reduction into the three components of (i) provider price 
inflation (ii) consumer price shopping and (iii) quantity reductions and
 find that almost all of the overall drop in spending is due to quantity
 reductions. We investigate the reduction in spending as a function of 
(i) consumer demographics (ii) consumer health status and (iii) types of
 medical services consumed. We also investigate how consumers respond to
 the complex structure of the non-linear high-deductible contract, and 
find that the majority of incremental spending reductions at any point 
in the calendar year come from consumers who are under the deductible. 
We investigate whether consumers respond to (i) expected end-of-year 
marginal prices (ii) spot prices at the time of care and (iii) ex ante 
average prices, and find that consumers respond to both expected 
end-of-year marginal prices and spot prices.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10833_abstract">We
 investigate the adoption and performance effects of data-driven 
decision-making (DDD) in U.S. firms. Our study relies on a novel survey 
of managerial practices conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau combined 
with other detailed data on information technology (IT) investment and 
firm performance in the manufacturing sector. Using a 
differences-in-differences approach, we find that plants adopting DDD 
exhibit an average increase of 3% in value-added between 2005 and 2010. 
For the average plant in our sample, this increase is on par with the 
productivity benefit from investing an additional $5 million in IT 
capital, or $60 thousand per employee over the five-year period. Because
 IT use is managerially and statistically distinct from IT investment, 
we take this as evidence that it can be just as important for firm 
performance. Moreover, DDD displays important complementarities with 
other organizational choices such as employee education and the 
allocation of decision rights. Furthermore, the variation in the timing 
and distribution of DDD effects suggests there are complex and costly 
organizational adjustments as firms adapt to new technological 
possibilities.</div>

acknowledging the possible un-intentionality of the infringement has a 
large positive effect; and imposing a deadline after which the forgiven

 has a multitude of environmental regulations but a history of poor 
enforcement. Between 1996 and 2004, India's Supreme Court required 17 
cities to enact Action Plans to reduce air pollution through a variety 
of command-and-control (CAC) environmental regulations. We compare the 
impacts of these regulations with the impact of changes in coal prices 
on establishment-level pollution abatement, coal consumption, and 
productivity growth. We find that higher coal prices reduced coal use 
within establishments, with price elasticities similar to those found in
 the US. In addition, higher coal prices are associated with lower 
pollution emissions at the district level. CAC regulations did not 
affect within-establishment pollution control investment or coal use, 
but did impact the extensive margin, increasing the share of large 
establishments investing in pollution control and reducing the entry of 
new establishments. For reducing SO2 emissions, our results suggest that
 higher coal prices were more effective in improving environmental 
outcomes than command and control measures.</div>

 pollution is a major environmental issue in China resulting in 
widespread health and ecological problems. This paper exploits the 
relocation of two major power plants in Chengdu, China as a 
quasi-natural experiment to examine the effect of changes in the quality
 of the environment on the housing market. We use an extensive 
transaction dataset of new apartment units to analyze variations in 
housing prices and volume of transactions in the affected areas compared
 to neighboring areas. The estimation results are consistent with the 
predictions of a hedonic price model. We find that the closure of the 
power plants is associated with over a 6% increase in prices and a 
65-108% rise in the volume of weekly transactions. We further observe a 
higher increase in prices among more expensive houses. The estimated 
gross value of the closures is close to 89 million US dollars over the 
first ten months after the relocation of the two plants.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11286_abstract">In
 this paper we execute a rigorous assessment of the impact of 
restorations of rivers and streams on recreational fishing, a well-known
 ecosystem service. This question is addressed by investigating whether 
there is any statistical evidence that river restorations led to 
significant effects on outcomes related to recreational fishing, that 
is, whether restorations had any effects on catch per trip and the 
number of fishing trips in streams and rivers. The analysis is based on 
an empirical application to recreational fishing on the streams in the 
canton of Graubünden, Switzerland using a uniquely rich and detailed 
dataset including historical data on river restorations, eco-morphology 
and connectivity, fish stocking, individual fishing trips and anglers’ 
characteristics, and stocking all at the stream section level for the 
period 2002-2012 for around 25,000 anglers. Combining matching 
techniques and panel data analysis, our preliminary analysis suggests 
that an improvement of the environmental good, i.e., stream 
restorations, leads to more frequent and larger catches of brown trout 
and other desirable fish. Thanks to the available information on the 
restorations and the eco-morphological state of each section we are able
 to pinpoint which types of restoration are necessary to induce an 
observable effect on fishing behavior. This research project provides 
initial empirical evidence of the effects of restorations of rivers. 
Furthermore, it delivers valuable indications to policy makers and 
practitioners on how to design restoration projects in order to increase
 both the quantity and the quality of an ecosystem service such as 
recreational fishing.</div>

 contracts with private firms increasingly incorporate environmental 
objectives or preferences for sustainable products and producers. At the
 same time, the government often solicits competitive bids to reduce the
 rents captured by the firms due to private information. In this paper, I
 show how environmental objectives can influence equilibrium contract 
bids through changes to firm costs, strategic bidding behavior, and 
bidder participation decisions. Using data from Michigan state logging 
contracts, I find that conservation objectives reduce bidder 
participation in the contract auctions by up to 35 percent and depress 
winning bids by up to 17 percent. To disentangle compliance costs from 
logger margins, I estimate a structural model of the auctions. 
Simulations based on the estimates imply that the policy imposes 
economically and statistically significant compliance costs. Loggers are
 able to completely pass these costs on to the government because 
compliance costs do not substantially affect the dispersion of private 
values. However, the use of optimal reserve prices partially mitigates 
the revenue disparity between more- and less-restricted contracts. 
Finally, loggers capture a larger share of total auction surplus for 
restricted contracts, indicating that the policy undermines the state’s 
ability to harness competition to capture surplus.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10828_abstract">Electricity
 markets in many countries are following two trends. First, governments 
are fostering the growth of renewable electricity generation to respond 
to environmental concerns and to increase energy independence. Second, 
many countries are implementing competitive wholesale electricity 
markets.

This paper shows that these two goals are incompatible. Large amounts of
 renewable generation will not be able to survive in competitive 
wholesale electricity markets without subsidies. Specifically, if the 
installed capacity of zero marginal cost renewable generation becomes 
sufficiently large, the optimal behavior of each individual producer 
will drive market prices to values that are too low to compensate for 
their own fixed costs. In the limit, if all electricity was generated by
 competitive wind and solar producers, market prices would always be 
zero, which would clearly lead to a market failure.

To illustrate this effect, we simulate a simple  model of electricity 
demand and supply with three types of generators: wind, solar, and 
traditional thermal generation. The model is calibrated to  data from 
Germany and Spain. These two countries are examples of large electric 
systems where renewables already represent a significant part of the 
total load. The results show that the revenues obtained by solar and 
wind generators will quickly drop to insufficient levels in a 
competitive market setting without subsidies.</div>

 paper analyses how the distribution of parental wealth transforms into 
the wealth distribution of children, and in particular the role of 
bequest in this transformation. Our primary findings are: (i) Wealth/ 
potential bequest is rather unequally distributed among the deceased 
with the top 1% group having 27‐28 percent of total wealth, and 40 
percent of the deceased leaving no bequest. (ii) After receiving 
bequests, children move on average 3‐4 percentiles up in the 
(counterfactual) without‐bequest wealth distribution. (iii) The wealth 
distribution of children moves to the right after receiving bequest but 
the effects are much larger in the upper part of the distribution. This 
implies that wealth inequality increases so that 20 percent of the 
variance in the child wealth distribution is explained by bequest. (iv) 
The relationship between wealth of parents and children becomes stronger
 when measuring child wealth after receiving bequest with an 
intergenerational rank‐rank correlation increasing from 0.21 to 0.31, 
implying that bequest may explain around 30 percent of the 
intergenerational rank correlation. (v) Close to 15 percent of children 
with parents in the top 1% group are also in the top 1% group before 
receiving bequest, while close to 20% of these children are in the top 
1% group after receiving bequest.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13028_abstract">In
 2010, the U.S. estate tax expired for one year, and was replaced by a 
basis carryover regime for capital gains on assets transferred to heirs.
 When the estate tax was reinstated in 2011, it was retroactively 
extended to 2010 on an optional basis.  Executors of estates of 2010 
decedents could choose between being taxed under the 2011 estate tax 
regime with its associated basis-step up on bequeathed assets, and under
 the basis carry-over regime of 2010.  This presented estate tax filers 
with a choice between a current estate tax liability and a potential 
future capital gains tax liability.  Some estates were taxed under each 
of the two tax regimes.  This paper presents evidence on the choices 
reflected in the estate tax filings of 2010 decedents.  It begins by 
summarizing the considerations that could affect an executor’s choice 
between filing under each of the tax regimes.  It then compares the 
estates filed under each of the tax regimes in 2010 to investigate 
whether the factors that might affect relative tax liability appear to 
affect taxpayers decisions, and it compares estate tax returns filed in 
2010 with returns filed in 2009, 2011, and 2012 to describe differences 
that may have been associated with the optional basis carryover regime 
in 2010.  While the findings do not provide an explicit test of 
tax-efficient behavior by estate tax filers, they do provide evidence 
that filing choices were consistent with such behavior.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12830_abstract">This
 paper provides experimental evidence on the effect of affirmative 
action (AA). In particular, we investigate whether affirmative action 
has a ”stereotype threat effect” – that is, whether AA cues a negative 
stereotype that leads individuals to conform to the stereotype and 
adversely affects their performance. Stereotype threat has been shown in
 the literature to be potentially significant for individuals who 
identify strongly with the domain of the stereotype and who engage in 
complex stereotype-relevant tasks. We therefore explore this question in
 the context of gender-based AA for a complex math task. In this 
context, the stereotype is most relevant for women with high math 
ability, and the stereotype threat effects can be expected to work in 
the opposite direction to AA’s competition effect that encourages women 
to compete. We find that, consistent with the presence of a stereotype 
threat, AA has an overall negative effect on the performance of 
high-ability women performing complex math tasks.</div>

increase risk taking after an increase in income and in the presence of

 use a controlled laboratory experiment to explore how gender and gender
 stereotypes impact team decision-making. Teams face problems from a 
variety of domains, both male and female-typed, and are rewarded when 
right answers are contributed. We focus on an individual’s willingness 
to contribute her answers, varying the gender composition of the teams. 
While men respond to the gender-type of the category, contributing more 
often in male-typed categories than female-typed categories, they do not
 respond to the gender of their partner. Men are equally likely to 
provide their answers to their group whether they are paired with a man 
or a woman. Women, on the other hand, do respond to the gender of their 
partner. Conditional on how many answers they know and how confident 
they are in these answers, women are less willing to contribute their 
answers to the group when they are paired with men than when they are 
paired with women. This is particularly true in male-typed domains. 
Women fail to contribute 24% of their correct answers in male-typed 
categories when paired with women and 43% of their correct answers in 
male-typed categories when paired with men. We also find that having a 
male partner has a negative impact on the probability that a woman 
answers a male-typed question correctly. Conditional on a baseline 
measure of knowledge collected before the assignment of a partner, women
 are 8.4 percentage points less likely to answer a male-typed question 
correctly after they are paired with a man than after they are paired 
with a woman. We document how these behaviors impact the efficiency of

youths that applied to the TVVP, a random half were awarded a voucher 
for vocational training, while the other half served as the control 
group. Of the voucher winners, a random half were awarded a voucher that
 could only be used in public (government) institutions, while the other
 half received a voucher that could be used in either private or public 
institutions. The project also included a cross-cutting information 
intervention, which exposed a randomly selected half of all treatment 
and control individuals to information about the actual returns to 
vocational education. This paper focuses on program take-up, the demand 
for vocational training and the impacts of the information intervention 
on institution and course selection, participant attendance, the 
short-term impacts of training on labor market expectations and outcomes
 for a representative subset of program participants, and training 
center characteristics. The paper also provides some suggestive evidence
 on the supply-side impacts of the program.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13492_abstract">Much
 remains unknown about how students choose colleges. The structure of 
student preferences is critical to understanding how greater competition
 or better-informed students would affect college quality, amenities, 
and tuition costs. We shed light on these questions with new 
administrative data from a large online college application platform. We
 observe applications, acceptances, and matriculation choices for 
hundreds of thousands of U.S. high school graduates since 2011. We 
document how students trade off college attributes such as quality, 
price, distance to home, admission risk, and academic, racial, and 
social match with the student body. Because we observe the set of 
colleges that students consider along with their applications we can 
identify student preferences over multiple college characteristics. We 
document substantial differences in preferences and application 
strategies across socio-economic groups and across high schools. The 
placement history at a student’s high school is a key determinant of his
 own application behavior.</div>

 and information constraints can affect not only participation levels in
 different occupations, but also the types of individuals found in those
 occupations. I develop a model of occupational choice which shows how 
new information alters expectations and thus occupational choice. Credit
 and information constraints also interact with each other: the same 
information can have opposing impacts on occupational choice depending 
on the presence of credit constraints. Using a survey and information 
experiment in seven vocational high schools in Egypt, I find support for
 the model’s predictions, including a key compositional prediction: risk
 averse individuals respond more to changes in expectations of risk at 
both the intensive (variance of income) and extensive (probability of 
finding a job) margins. This differential response leads highly risk 
averse individuals to shift towards "safer" occupations on average, and 
out of using credit to start a small enterprise. Because those who are 
risk averse report lower returns to credit in general (by favoring lower
 risk/lower return investments), the average expected income for those 
utilizing credit rises by 12% relative to the no information case.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13494_abstract">Despite
 a robust college premium, college attendance rates in the US have 
remained stagnant and exhibit a substantial socioeconomic gradient. We 
focus on information gaps – specifically, incomplete information about 
college benefits and costs – as a potential explanation for these 
patterns. For this purpose, we conduct an information experiment about 
college returns and benefits, embedded within a nationally 
representative survey of US household heads. We show that, at the 
baseline, perceptions of college costs and benefits are severely and 
systematically biased: 70 percent of our respondents underestimate true 
college benefits (defined as average earnings of a college graduate 
relative to a non-college worker in the population), while 61 percent 
report net public college costs that exceed actual net costs. There is 
also substantial heterogeneity in beliefs, with evidence of larger 
biases for the more disadvantaged groups, lower-income and non-college 
households. We also elicit respondents’ intended likelihood of their 
(own or friend’s pre-college age) child attending college, the main 
behavioral outcome of interest. Respondents are then randomly exposed to
 one of two information experiments, which provide objective information
 about true college returns and true costs, respectively. For 
individuals treated with objective college returns information, the 
child’s intended college attendance increases significantly, by about 
0.2 of the standard deviation in the baseline intended likelihood. 
Importantly, as a result of the information intervention, gaps in 
intended college attendance by household income or parents’ education 
persist but decline by 20-30 percent. We find no impact of the cost 
intervention on intended college attendance. We are in the process of 
collecting data on medium-term impacts of the information, which will 
allow us to investigate whether the impacts are persistent.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12186_abstract">Prior
 research in economics and psychology has documented that individuals 
exhibit time-inconsistent preferences when faced with the opportunity to
 take an action that involves immediate costs in return for future 
benefits – the notion of implementing such an action now is unappealing,
 but the notion of implementing the same action later is attractive. 
Because increasing contributions to a retirement savings plan requires a
 reduction in current consumption (an immediate cost) in order to 
increase consumption in old age (a future benefit), individuals may be 
more likely to agree to a contribution rate increase if they have the 
option to have the increase implemented at a delay. We conducted a field
 experiment with several universities to test whether the option to 
choose a delayed contribution rate increase boosts savings. Relative to 
employees who are offered a convenient mechanism for increasing their 
contribution rates immediately, employees who are offered a convenient 
mechanism for increasing their contribution rates immediately or at a 
delay are no more likely to agree to an increase. In fact, the latter 
group exhibits lower savings rates over the coming months, as the 
delayed option attracts some employees. However, when the delayed option
 is framed as being implemented after a psychologically meaningful 
moment, such as an employee’s next birthday, the negative effect of 
offering a delayed option is undone.</div>

 is considerable variation in retirement savings within income, age, and
 educational categories. Using a broad sample of the U.S. population, we
 elicit time preference parameters from a quasi-hyperbolic discounting 
model, and perceptions of exponential growth. We find that present bias 
(PB), the tendency to value utility in the present over the future in a 
dynamically inconsistent way, and exponential-growth bias (EGB), the 
tendency to neglect compounding, are prevalent and distinct latent 
variables. PB, EGB, and the long-run discount factor are all highly 
significant in predicting retirement savings, even while controlling for
 measures of IQ and general financial literacy as well as a rich set of 
demographic controls. We find that lack of self-awareness of these 
biases has an additional independent negative impact on retirement 
savings. We assess potential threats to a causal interpretation of our 
results with a hypothetical choice experiment and several robustness 
exercises. Finally, we explore potential mechanisms for our findings. If
 the relationship we estimate is causal, our estimates suggest that 
eliminating PB and EGB would be associated with an increase in 
retirement savings of 12%, or as high as 70% using estimates that 
account for classical measurement error.</div>

 use a stochastic life cycle model which incorporates endogenous 
knowledge accumulation to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace 
financial education. We show that our model explains a number of 
important features of financial education programs. For example, we show
 that it is frequently optimal for individuals to fail to invest in 
knowledge, as it is expensive to acquire and will not benefit everyone. 
Nevertheless, providing employees with financial knowledge can be 
valuable, depending on when it is offered and how much follow up is 
undertaken. Using conventional program evaluation econometric techniques
 married with simulated data, we can explicitly take into account 
selection and treatment effects: this allows us to measure how such 
programs shape wealth accumulation, financial knowledge, and 
participation in sophisticated assets (e.g. stocks) across heterogeneous
 consumers. We show that more effective programs are those which embed 
follow-up (or are continued over time) so as to help employees retain 
knowledge acquired via the program. In this case, financial education 
delivered to employees around the age of 40 will optimally enhance 
savings at retirement by close to 10%. By contrast, a program that 
provides only a one-shot intervention can generate short-term but few 
long-term effects. Finally, we evaluate how important it is to account 
for selection in program participation. We conclude that comparing 
participants and non-participants, even in a difference-in-difference 
framework, can deliver misleading estimates of program effectiveness.</div>

partially-refundable premiums, in a realistic world with uncertain labor

firms changes over time. Using a panel of US multinational firms over 25
 years from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, we classify FDI as 
vertical, horizontal, or export platform and trace the evolution of 
these three types of FDI within firms over time.  In general, when firms
 first enter new markets they focus narrowly on one type of FDI, but 
then diversify over time. These patterns can be explained by a theory of
 fixed costs of multinational production in which the costs of beginning
 a new type of FDI (vertical, horizontal, or export platform) are

 start by bringing new evidence on the dynamics of multinational firms 
and trade by using a combination of firm-level panel data for Norway and
 Germany. First, exit rates for new exporters almost double the ones for
 new affiliates of multinational firms, while multinational firms with 
previous export experience show the lowest exit rates. Second, new 
affiliates of multinational firms have much flatter growth profiles than
 exporters. Finally, affiliates of multinational firms in their entry 
year are more productive than affiliates with previous export experience
 that in turn are more productive than new exporters in their entry 
year.
We show how far a simple dynamic extension of the model in Helpman, 
Melitz, and Yeaple (2004) goes in explaining the dynamic patterns 
observed in the data. Even though the baseline model captures 
qualitatively some of the dynamic facts we document, our calibrated

 is the private return to innovation? When firms operate production 
sites in multiple countries, improvements developed at one site may be 
shared across others for efficiency gain. We develop a dynamic model

 to measure innovation returns for a comprehensive panel of U.S. 
multinationals during 1989–2009. We find that the data, which include 
detailed measures of affiliate-level production and innovation, are 
consistent with innovation generating returns at firm locations beyond 
the innovating
site. Accounting for cross-plant effects of innovation, our most

 role of trade and foreign investment in explaining the magnitude and 
growth of business cycle synchronization has been the subject of some 
debate. In previous work, Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar (2014), we 
have shown that&lt;br /&gt;
the imports of multinational firms exhibit very little substitutability 
with other domestic factors in the short run. We incorporate these 
complementarities of intermediate input trade by multinationals into an 
otherwise conventional model of cross-country business cycle dynamics 
and show that this channel does indeed generate substantial effects in 
the aggregate. In the baseline model value-added co-movement increases 
by 11 percentage points relative to a model where such vertical linkages
 are absent. The model demonstrates that real linkages – in addition to 
financial linkages and policy spillovers – can play a quantitatively 
meaningful role in aggregate business cycle synchronization.</div>

 catchword ‘green skills’ has been common parlance in policy circles for
 a while, yet there is little systematic empirical research to guide 
public intervention for meeting the demand for skills that will be 
needed to operate and develop green technology. We present a data-driven
 methodology to identify occupational skills that are relevant for 
environmental sustainability. We find that these green skills are mostly
 engineering and technical know-how related to the design, production, 
management and monitoring of technology. We also evaluate the effect of 
environmental regulation on the demand of green skills exploiting 
exogenous geographical variation in regulatory stringency for a panel of
 US metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas over the period 2006-2014. 
Our results suggest that, while these recent changes in environmental 
regulation have no impact on overall employment, they create significant
 gaps in the demand for some green skills, especially those related to 
technical and engineering skills. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11256_abstract">Occupational
 licensure, the legal process establishing qualifications to practice a 
trade or profession, has become one of the most significant labor market
 regulations in the US. The percent of the workforce licensed at the 
state level grew from around 5% in the 1950s to almost 23% in 2008, with
 a 28% increase since 1980.   Migration rates within the United States 
have fallen dramatically, with a decline in between-state migration of 
50% over the last 20 years. We examine to what extent occupational 
licensing may be a contributing factor to the decline in interstate 
migration.  Occupational licensing adds a significant barrier to moving 
between states, as often an individual must fulfill new licensing 
requirements in order to practice their occupation in another state. Our
 analysis of five licensed occupations shows that, after controlling for
 demographic characteristics, individuals in these occupations have 
lower interstate migration rates than their peers in other occupations, 
while the rate at which they move within states is similar.  To 
establish whether or not licensing is behind these differences, we 
perform a difference-in-difference analysis using changes in state 
licensing laws.  State policies on accepting those who fulfill licensing
 requirements in other states as qualified to practice in their state 
(called endorsement) and on forming agreements with other states on 
establishing licensing requirements (called reciprocity) are amended 
often.  Our analysis for lawyers shows that lawyers in states that adopt
 these policies have increased migration rates after the adoption of 
these policies compared to lawyers in states with no such policies. We 
will repeat this analysis for additional occupations.  Our results show 
that the additional costs occupational licensing places on migration has
 restricted the movement of individuals in licensed occupations, 
accounting for part of the decrease in overall migration in the US.</div>

 economists recognize that labor migration is one of the most direct 
strategies for escaping poverty. Yet, considerable debate remains over 
whether and how migration affects communities of origin over the long 
run. This paper provides new evidence of one channel through which 
circular labor migration has lasting effects on origin communities: by 
raising human capital formation of the next generation. We estimate the 
net effects of labor migration from Malawi to the South African mines 
using a difference-in-differences strategy, along with newly digitized 
Census and administrative data on access to mine jobs, and two plausibly
 exogenous shocks to the option to migrate. Twenty years after these 
shocks subsided, human capital is 4.8-6.9% higher among cohorts who were
 eligible for schooling in those communities of origin with the easiest 
access to migrant jobs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10411_abstract">By
 applying a counterfactual quantile regression analysis to historic U.S.
 data, we show that the evolution of wage inequality in the lower 
echelon of the wage distribution was due entirely to a reduction of 
within-group wage inequality, which was determined, in turn, by more 
homogeneous remuneration paid to workers performing routine tasks. 
Changes in the differential between the remuneration paid to 
technology-complementary and technology-substitute tasks had only a 
negligible impact on wage inequality among low-wage workers, which casts
 some doubt on the validity of basing a theory of wage inequality on 
routinization-biased technical change operating through a labor demand 
channel.&lt;br /&gt;
To reconcile the routinization hypothesis with the data, we develop a 
model in which skill-heterogeneous workers face endogenous occupational 
choices and learning costs in connection with operating a new 
technology.&lt;br /&gt;
Even in the absence of changes in wage differentials, the model argues 
that technical change can generate an empirically consistent 
non-monotone effect on wage inequality by affecting the average level of
 skills within different groups of workers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11708_abstract">There
 is concern that state licensure requirements impede efficient mobility 
of licensed professionals to areas of high demand. Nursing has not been 
immune to this criticism, especially in light of perceived persistent 
nurse shortages and large expected future demand. The Nurse Licensure 
Compact (NLC) was introduced to solve this problem by permitting 
registered nurses to practice across state lines and making licensure 
easier to obtain for nurses moving between member states. We exploit the
 staggered adoption of the NLC across states and over time to examine 
whether a reduction in licensure-induced barriers alters the nurse labor
 market. Using data on over 1.5 million nurses and other health care 
workers from the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 2006-2012 American 
Community Surveys, we estimate the effects of NLC adoption on commuting 
patterns and labor force outcomes. We specifically examine whether NLC 
adoption is associated with a greater likelihood of cross-state 
commuting, an increase in commuting times, and changes to employment and
 labor force participation. Our results indicate no effect of NLC 
adoption on employment and labor force participation. Estimates are 
precise enough to rule out even small impacts on employment and labor 
force participation. Thus, it does not appear that cross-state licensing
 restrictions impact the aggregate labor supply of nurses. However, we 
find modest positive effects of NLC adoption on travel time to work as 
well as the likelihood of working across state lines, particularly among
 nurses living in MSAs that encompass multiple states. This suggests 
that eliminating cross-state licensure restrictions expands the 
geographic scope of the nurse labor market.</div>

 paper explores the labor market and schooling effects of the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which provides work 
authorization to eligible immigrants along with a temporary reprieve 
from deportation.  The analysis relies on a difference-in-differences 
approach that exploits the discontinuity in program rules to compare 
eligible individuals to ineligible, likely undocumented immigrants 
before and after the program went into effect.  To address potential 
endogeneity concerns, we focus on youths that likely met DACA’s 
schooling requirement when the program was announced.  We find that DACA
 reduced the probability of school enrollment of eligible 
higher-educated individuals, as well as some evidence that it increased 
the employment likelihood of men, in particular.  Together, these 
findings suggest that a lack of authorization may lead individuals to 
enroll in school when working is not a viable option.  Thus, once 
employment restrictions are relaxed and the opportunity costs of 
higher-education rise, eligible individuals may reduce investments in 
schooling.</div>

 focus on the decentralized provision of public education in a middle 
income country, and provide original empirical evidence on heterogeneous
 impacts of autonomy, depending on the levels of development 
characterizing local authorities. Colombian municipalities were assigned
 to administer their public education service autonomously solely on the
 basis of whether they exceeded the 100 thousand inhabitants threshold. 
Exploiting this discontinuity, I look at the heterogeneous impact that 
autonomy has had on student test scores across municipalities using a 
regression discontinuity design and fixed-effects regression on a 
discontinuity sample. I find a test score gap arising between autonomous
 municipalities in the top quartile and those in the bottom quartile of 
the development range, in a trend that reinforces over time. From 
analysis of detailed municipal balance sheet data, I show that 
top-quartile municipalities are wealthier and invest in education more 
than the ad hoc transfers they receive, supplementing these with own 
financial resources. Significant differences that help explaining 
outcome patterns are also found in indicators of municipal 
administration quality.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14480_abstract">The
 rapid increase in the number of college students with student loan debt
 and the amount of debt borrowed to finance post-secondary education 
have attracted increasing attention as potential threats to the 
financial well-being of young adults and to the broader economy. 
However, little research has focused on pre-graduation interventions 
that may change the subsequent student loan choices and academic 
performance of college students. We exploit a natural experiment that 
sent “Know Your Debt” letters to raise awareness of students’ education 
debt levels and provided incentivized offers of one-on-one financial 
counseling. The letters warned students that their debt levels were high
 relative to their standing in class and the projected salaries for 
their majors. This intervention was targeted at Montana State University
 students reaching a specific debt threshold, where a separate threshold
 existed for freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors; the University 
of Montana provided no comparable intervention. We use a 
difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) identification strategy to
 compare students above and below the thresholds, across campuses, and 
before and after the intervention to determine how the letters affected 
students’ academic and loan choices in the subsequent semesters. 
Employing a never-before-used rich administrative dataset that contains 
detailed individual-level information on all Montana University System 
students, their academic records, and detailed financial aid packages, 
we find that students receiving the letters take out an average of 
$1,450 less in the subsequent semester—almost one-third less than 
students in the comparison group. If the slower pace of debt 
accumulation is due to these students working part-time jobs, it does 
not adversely affect their academic performance. In fact, those who 
receive the intervention take more credits and have higher GPAs in the 
subsequent semester. For freshmen, the intervention increases the 
probability of declaring a STEM major and improves one-year college 
retention probabilities by 5 percent.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12259_abstract">In
 the United States, taxation of commodities falls under both sales and 
use taxes.  Sales taxes are due at the point of sale for 
brick-and-mortar transactions, while use taxes are due on goods 
purchased in neighbouring jurisdictions and on Internet sales.  When 
governments differ in size and maximize tax revenue, the optimal use tax
 rate is equal to the sales tax rate.  However, the optimal use tax rate
 does not equal the sales tax rate when asymmetric governments maximize 
social welfare while competing for cross-border shoppers.  Decreases in 
the sales tax rate of the large jurisdiction will result in the large 
jurisdiction lowering its use tax rate.  Intuitively, a decrease in the 
large jurisdiction’s sales tax rate decreases the amount of cross-border
 shopping, which shrinks the use tax base and reduces incentives to have
 a high use tax rate.  In most states, towns are allowed to levy sales 
and use tax rates.  We assemble the first ever panel dataset of use tax 
rates for every town in the United States over the last ten years.  We 
document that approximately 15% of towns levy a use tax rate that is 
lower than the town’s sales tax rate.  We then use changes in the sales 
and use tax rates over time to identify factors that induce a 
municipality to levy a use tax rate that is different than its sales tax
 rates.  Given the large increases in e-commerce and the fraction of 
taxable sales that are subject to use taxes, the results of the 
empirical model suggest that governments may maximize social welfare 
rather than tax revenue.</div>

 do state tax rates respond to federal tax shocks? This paper presents a
 novel mechanism of heterogeneous vertical tax externalities across 
levels of fiscal advantage, showing that tax increases can be 
expansionary -- even without their reinvestment. States rich with 
natural resources have a fiscal advantage in the inter-state competition
 over production factors which allows them to respond better to changes 
in federal taxes and, consequently, attract capital from other parts of 
the nation. We add heterogeneity in fiscal advantage levels to an 
otherwise standard model of vertical tax externalities and horizontal 
tax competition; the model shows that, irrespective of federal 
redistribution, the contractionary effect of a federal tax increase can 
be overturned in states with high fiscal advantage, through an increase 
in their tax base. Using the case of the U.S., and narrative-based 
measured federal tax shocks a-la Romer and Romer (2010), we provide 
empirical evidence for the various aspects of this mechanism. 
Specifically, our lower-bound estimates indicate that, controlling for 
federal transfers, a 1% increase in the GDP share of capital-related 
federal taxes at the beginning of a year increases the growth in the per
 capita tax base by approximately 1.6% in high fiscal advantage states 
at the end of it, on average.</div>

 about one percent. The effect comes largely through the largest party. 
It also is specific to the employment sector of the municipal employees.

associated with the increase in credit supply allows subprime 
households, whose ability to pay interest and hence to sustain debt is 
constrained by low levels income, to take on disproportionately more 
debt than the prime households, who are not subject to that constraint.

 design a model-based field experiment to estimate the nature and 
magnitude of workers' social preferences towards their employers, and 
how such preferences affect effort under different pay schemes. We study
 temporary workers (n=446) hired for multiple employers, exploiting 
randomized within-subject and between-subject variation in (i) fixed pay
 and piece rates; (ii) whether the work has payoffs only for the worker,
 or also for the employer; and (iii) the exact return to the employer. 
The results indicate that workers have substantial baseline social 
preferences towards their employers, even in the absence of repeated 
game incentives. Consistent with models of warm glow but not pure 
altruism, workers exert substantially more effort when their work is 
consequential to their employer, but are insensitive to the precise 
return to the employer. Next, we test how worker social preferences 
respond to the employer's generosity or meanness to workers, by 
randomizing a positive (monetary or in-kind) or negative monetary “gift”

 campaign contributions reveal the actor’s party leanings, they take 
place in a domain of social observation and are likely to be subject to 
social effects. We conducted a ﬁeld experiment to identify some of these
 social effects. We sent letters to 92,000 contributors from all U.S. 
states during the 2012 presidential election campaign. We randomized 
subtle details in those letters to create non-deceptive experimental 
variation in the probability that the recipient’s contributions were 
observable to her neighbors, and in the recipient’s perception of the 
contributions of others. We use administrative data to measure the 
effects of these variations on the recipients’ subsequent contributions.
 We show that making an individual’s contributions more visible to her 
neighbors increases the contributions of supporters of the local 
majority party, and decreases those of supporters of the minority party.
 This evidence is consistent with a model of partisan signaling in which
 individuals treat supporters of their own party favorably and 
supporters of the opposite party unfavorably. Additionally, we show that
 individuals contribute more when they perceive higher average 
contributions from own-party supporters in their area, but not do not 
react to contributions from opposite party neighbors, which is 
consistent with social norm theories. Last, individuals contribute lower
 amounts when they perceive a higher share of own-party contributors, 
which can be interpreted as free-riding. Taken together, the evidence 
suggests that partisan interactions play an important role in shaping 
political participation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11155_abstract">This
 paper analyzes the impact of collective action clauses on the cost of 
borrowing of sovereigns. Specifically, the paper focuses on majority 
restructuring provisions which define the qualifying majority of 
bondholders that can modify the financial terms of the bonds. The 2012 
Greek restructuring and the ruling in U.S. courts against Argentina's 
appeal to pay holdout creditors have reignited the interest over the use
 and design of these clauses. I find that countries with higher 
willingness and greater ability to pay are more likely to have lower 
voting thresholds. I then document that voting requirements have, on 
average, a statistically significant positive effect on spreads at 
issuance. Lower rated sovereigns benefit most from using lower voting 
thresholds. Additionally, I show that these lower rated issuers benefit 
incrementally more after 2003. This result indicates a possible change 
in the market participants' perception about the use of these clauses 
after 2003. From a policy perspective, the results imply that market 
participants favor these contractual changes and that the current push 
for further contractual reforms will likely be beneficial. However, the 
analysis indicates that the standardization of such voting thresholds 
might not be desirable.</div>

 rescue policies in the Euro Area largely rest on the assumption that 
multiple equilibria existed at the onset of the crisis and were 
responsible for the surge of government bond spreads. In this study, we 
challenge the multiple equilibria hypothesis put forward by De Grauwe 
and Ji (2013), and recently also Saka et al. (2015). Building on earlier
 work by Steinkamp and Westermann (2014), we argue that standard 
interest rate specifications in this literature miss out on a 
statistically and economically significant explanatory variable: The 
share of public debt that is held by multilateral creditors. In the 
early crisis period, official creditors insisted on a preferred full 
repayment of their rescue loans in the case of a sovereign default. This
 lowered expected recovery rates for private market participants and 
made them demand higher marginal interest rates. The present paper 
extends the earlier findings by further analyzing the direction of 
causality. We follow three different identification approaches to 
account for a possible endogeneity of emergency lending and interest 
rates: First, we use a set of IV regressions where the differences 
between sovereign ratings serve as instruments. Second, we analyze a new
 panel-survey dataset on seniority and interest rate expectations. In 
both approaches, we find evidence for the seniority conundrum – i.e., a 
positive impact of multilateral loans on interest rate spreads. Third, 
we analyze the events surrounding the announcement of the OMT. Making 
use of a novel data set from a large private prediction market, we are 
able to attribute the news reaction of government bond spreads to the 
underlying changes in the recovery rate and the default probability. </div>

 credit default swap (CDS) contract provides insurance against default. 
After a country defaults, the country and its lenders usually negotiate 
over the share of the defaulted debt to be repaid. This paper 
incorporates CDS contracts into a sovereign default model and 
demonstrates that the existence of a CDS market results in lower default
 probability, higher debt levels, and lower financing costs for the 
country. Since the CDS payout is not automatically triggered by losses 
from renegotiations, the lender needs to be compensated for lower 
expected insurance payments. This leads to higher debt repayment in 
renegotiation, decreasing the benefits of defaulting, and hence allowing
 the country to borrow more at lower rates. Uncertainty over the 
insurance payout when the debt is renegotiated explains why in the data,
 as the output declines, the CDS spread becomes lower than the bond 
spread. Furthermore, this pricing diynamic during a debt crisis can be 
used to infer market perceptions of the probability of the CDS paying 
out after a renegotiation. The model is calibrated to Greek data and 
shows that increasing CDS levels from 0 to 5% of debt lowers the 
unconditional default probability from 2.6% to 2.0% per year with no 
impact on debt level. Further increasing the CDS to 40% of debt 
increases the equilibrium debt level by 15%, but also increases the 
probability of default to 3.1%.</div>

 We address sovereign default in a macroeconomic model with infinite 
horizon and we highlight the impact of the rule of default on the 
occurrence and frequency of default through the risk premium set by 
markets on public debt. Our model allows us to define two steady-states,
 one stable, the other unstable. There is default when public debt is 
heading toward the unstable steady-state. We define the “default 
threshold” as the upper limit of public debt beyond which the default 
occurs with unit probability. Reasoning on a specification of the 
default rule, we characterize a critical value for the haircut ratio, 
leading us to define the notion of “realistically sustainable debt”. 
Below this ratio, absent any further shocks, the dynamics of 
post-default public debt is not realistically sustainable because it 
leads inevitably to a future default. Above it, the post-default public 
debt converges to the (stable) steady state and is therefore 
“realistically sustainable”. Our analysis puts to the fore the crucial 
and ambivalent role of the haircut ratio on the dynamics of public debt.</div>

 paper examines the potential for monetary policy to avoid 
self-fulfilling sovereign debt crises. We combine a version of the 
slow-moving debt crisis model proposed by Lorenzoni and Werning (2014) 
with a standard New Keynesian model. Monetary policy could preclude a 
debt crisis through raising inflation and output and lowering the real 
interest rate. These reduce the real value of outstanding debt and the 
cost of new borrowing, and increase tax revenues and seigniorage. 
However, the policies needed to avert a crisis generally require 
excessive inflation for a sustained period of time so that the central 
bank cannot credibly avoid a self-fulfilling debt crisis.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10060_abstract">Many
 observers argue that the increase in earnings inequality and the 
overtaking of female to male schooling attainment since the seventies 
led to (1) more positive assortative matching in marriage by educational
 attainment and (2) significant decline in US marriage rates. Due to the
 rise of single female headed households, the weffare of children 
suffered. Using the Choo Siow marriage matching function, this paper 
provides a quantitative assessment of these claims for marital behavior 
from 1970 to 2010 in the US. Although US marriage rates fell 
significantly, we show that increasing earnings inequality and changes 
in the schooling attainment distributions by gender contributed modestly
 to this decline. There is little evidence of an increase in PAM among 
college graduates.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10061_abstract">This
 paper documents that, over the last century, U. S. marriage patterns 
and the gender educational gap followed a non-monotonic pattern. Cohorts
 born around the turn of the 20th century married late and they 
typically had slightly more educated wives than husbands, although the 
overall spousal education levels were very low. For cohorts born between
 the two World Wars, marriages occurred earlier and they involved 
husbands who were significantly more educated than their wives. Among 
the later born cohorts, marriages began to occur later and they involved
 more educated spouses with narrower gender gaps. In order to explain 
these patterns, we propose a multi-period framework in a frictionless 
matching model where educational and marriage decisions are endogenous. 
The two key features of our theory are that marriage requires a fixed 
entry cost and that married couples cannot study simultaneously. This

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10062_abstract">For
 much of the 19th century, American common law dictated that a woman’s 
property became her husband’s property upon marriage. Beginning in the 
1840s, U.S. states began enacting laws allowing married women to retain 
ownership of their separate property, allowing varying degrees of 
control over this property to the women themselves. We provide some of 
the first micro-level evidence on the effect of these laws on 
assortative matching in the marriage market and family asset growth, 
focusing on a class of laws introduced in the American South during the 
1840s. These laws did not grant married women autonomy over their 
separate property; they merely shielded this property from seizure by 
their husbands’ creditors, effectively preserving this property as an 
inheritance for the couple’s children. Focusing on these laws allows us 
to isolate some of the many mechanisms through which married women’s 
property laws may have affected our outcomes of interest. Using a newly 
compiled database of linked marriage and census records, we show that 
couples married after the passage of a new property law had less real 
estate wealth in 1850 than couples married before, conditional on prior 
socioeconomic status; however, this is only true of couples of lower ex 
ante socioeconomic status. In addition, we show that assortative 
matching on wealth declined after the passage of these laws.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12612_abstract">This
 paper studies the quantitative implications of wealth taxation (as 
opposed to capital income taxation) in an incomplete markets model with 
return rate heterogeneity across individuals. The rate of return 
heterogeneity arises from the fact that some individuals have better 
entrepreneurial skills than others, allowing them to obtain a higher 
return on their wealth. With such heterogeneity, capital income and 
wealth taxes have different efficiency and distributional implications. 
Under capital income taxation, entrepreneurs who are more productive 
and, as a result, generate more income pay higher taxes. Under wealth 
taxation, on the other hand, entrepreneurs who have similar wealth 
levels pay similar taxes regardless of their productivity. Thus, in this
 environment, the tax burden would shift from productive entrepreneurs 
to unproductive ones if capital income tax were replaced with wealth 
tax. This reallocation increases aggregate productivity. Second, and at 
the same time, it increases wealth inequality in the population. To 
provide a quantitative assessment of these different effects, we build 
and simulate an overlapping generations model with individual-specific 
returns on capital income and idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Our 
results indicate that switching from capital income tax to wealth tax 
can generate large welfare gains through better allocation of capital. 
We study optimal taxation by allowing exemptions and progressivity.</div>

 paper provides two main contributions. First, it provides a new theory 
of wealth inequality that merges two forces generating inequality: 
bequest motives and inheritance of ability across generations;  and an 
earnings process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest. 
Second, it uses a calibrated  framework to study the effects of changing
 estate taxation on inequality, aggregate capital accumulation and 
output, the economic advantage of being born to a given parental 
background, and welfare. Our calibrated model generates realistically 
skewed distributions for wealth, earnings, and bequests and implies that
 parental background is a crucial determinant of one’s expected lifetime
 utility. We find that increasing the estate tax rate would 
significantly reduce wealth concentration in the hands of the richest 
few and would reduce the economic advantage of being born to a 
super-rich family, but also would lower aggregate capital and output. 
Lastly, it would also generate a significant welfare gain from the 
ex-ante standpoint of a newborn under the veil of ignorance.</div>

 examine the nature of the relationship between noncompetition 
agreements and employee mobility. A noncompetition agreement (also known
 as a covenant not to compete, or simply as a noncompete) restricts the 
ability of an employee to work for a competitor (or start a competing 
business) after termination. These agreements are a remarkably common 
feature of the U.S. labor market across all industries, occupations, and
 income levels (Starr et al. 2015). Recent academic work and interest 
from policy makers has raised questions about the effects these 
agreements might have on an employee’s freedom to seek employment 
elsewhere. In this paper, we outline a basic model of employee mobility,
 and consider the potential consequences of noncompetes for the entire 
process of mobility. With this framework, and using data from the 2014 
Noncompete Survey, we study how noncompetes are related to differences 
in search behavior, recruitment, job offers, and firm counteroffering 
behavior (separately studying technology and low-wage employees). We 
find that individuals with noncompetes are recruited and receive offers 
at relatively higher rates, and yet noncompetes are also associated with
 longer employment tenures. We consider some of the possible stories 
that would make sense of the patterns we identify.

 evidence suggests that economic dynamism and entrepreneurial activity 
are declining in the United States. Over the past thirty years, the 
annual number of new business startups and the pace of job reallocation 
have declined significantly. A variety of causes for these trends have 
been suggested, including an increasing ability of firms to respond to 
idiosyncratic shocks, technology induced changes in the costs of hiring 
and training, and increasing regulation. This research combines data 
from the Statistics of U.S. Businesses, which contains measures of the 
decline in economic dynamism, with RegData, a novel dataset leveraging 
the textual content of the Code of Federal Regulations. RegData contains
 annual industry level measures of the stringency of regulation. By 
combining these data, we are able to estimate the extent to which 
changes in the level of federal regulation can explain decreasing 
entrepreneurial activity and dynamism. We find that Federal regulation 
has had little to no effect on declining dynamism.</div>

migrate to a different region have both declined in the US since at least 2000. This paper
models declining mobility in a Search-and-Matching labor market with a job ladder and
endogenous search on the job. When the job-fnding rate for unemployed workers is low,
employed workers choose not to undertake costly search. As a result, they do not ascend the
job ladder. The paper also provides evidence of stagnant earnings among workers as a whole
and outright declines among young workers and in locations where the decline in mobility

is a picture of a slackening labor market extending over multiple business cycles, especially
harming young workers who are unable to ascend the job ladder.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20786_abstract">We analyze the impact of financial crises and monetary policy on the supply of wholesale
funding liquidity, and also on the compositional supply effects through cross-border and rela-
tionship lending. For empirical identification, we draw on the proprietary bank-to-bank Eu-
ropean interbank dataset extracted from Target2 and also exploit the Lehman and sovereign
crisis shocks as well as the main Eurosystem non-standard monetary policy measures. The
robust results imply that the crisis shocks lead to worse access, volumes and spreads (in both
the overnight and longer-term maturities). The quantitative impact on interbank access and
volume is stronger than on spreads. Liquidity supply restrictions are exacerbated for cross-
border lending after the Lehman failure; for banks headquartered in periphery countries, the
impact is quantitatively stronger in the sovereign debt crisis. Moreover, the interbank market
– unlike other credit markets – allows to exploit the price dispersion from different lenders
on identical credit contracts, i.e. overnight uncollateralized loans in the same morning for
the same borrower. This price dispersion increases massively with the crisis, and even more
for riskier borrowers. Cross-border and previous relationship lenders charge higher prices for
identical contracts in the crisis. Importantly, this price dispersion substantially decreases
when the Eurosystem promises unlimited access to liquidity at a fixed price in October 2008
and announces the 3-year LTRO in December 2011, with economically stronger effects for
borrowers in weaker countries.</div>

 analyze some of the potentially unintended consequences of the largest 
liquidity injection ever conducted by a central bank: the European 
Central Bank’s three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations conducted in 
December 2011 and February 2012. Using an unique dataset on monthly 
security- and bank-level holdings of government bonds for Portugal, we 
analyze the impact of this unconventional monetary policy operation on 
the demand for government debt. We find that: (i) Portuguese banks 
significantly increased their holdings of domestic government bonds 
after the announcement of this policy; (ii) This increase in holdings 
was tilted towards shorter maturities, with banks rebalancing their 
sovereign debt portfolios towards shorter term bonds. We employ a 
theoretical framework to argue that domestic banks engaged in a 
“collateral trade”, which involved the pur- chase of high yield bonds 
with maturities shorter than the central bank borrowing in order to 
mitigate funding liquidity risk. Our model delivers general equilibrium 
implications that are consistent with the data: the yield curve for the 
Portuguese sovereign steepens after the announcement, and the timing and
 characteristics of government bond auctions are consistent with a 
strategic response by the debt management agency.</div>

 a hand-collected sample of election nominations for more than 30,000 
directors over the period 2001–2010, we construct a novel firm-level 
measure of director proximity to elections—Years-to-election. Since 
directors often serve on multiple boards, the measure varies not only 
with director’s nomination status in a given firm, but also with her 
nomination status on other boards. We find that the closer members of a 
board are to their next director elections, the higher is CEO 
turnover–performance sensitivity. The results are driven by board 
members who are likely to influence CEO turnover decisions, such as 
chairmen and nomination committee members. A series of further 
tests—including tests that exploit variation in Years-to-election that 
comes from other boards—support a causal interpretation. Cross-sectional
 tests further show that, when other governance mechanisms are in place,
 CEO turnover–performance sensitivity is less affected by board 
Years-to-election. We conclude that director elections have important

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21426_abstract">In
 this research, I propose that shareholder control in the form of 
intervention threat, ex ante reduces firm manager's innovation 
incentives. The underlying mechanism is that pursuing innovation may 
negatively affect a firm's stock price efficiency, which may increase 
the risk of shareholder intervention. Thus, firm managers under the 
threat of shareholder intervention, may refrain from pursuing 
innovation. By examining a panel of 2,240 publicly traded U.S. firms, I 
find that shareholder intervention threat, as proxied by the ownership 
of institutional investors with a history of proxy fights, has a 
significant and economically important negative effect on firm 
innovation. To address the endogeneity of activist investor ownership, I
 exploit a novel identification strategy that relies on a natural 
experiment of activist investor closures to generate exogenous variation
 in the level of shareholder intervention threat. The results from the 
difference-in-differences estimation demonstrate that firm-level 
innovation are significantly improved following exogenous activist 
investor closures. Moreover, I find that when firms are subject to a 
greater degree of information asymmetry, the threat of shareholder 
intervention exerts larger negative effects on firm innovation. For 
firms in which monitoring investors have large holdings, the negative 
effect of shareholder intervention threat on innovation is substantially
 reduced. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21621_abstract">This
 paper uses matched employer-employee data to study the effects of 
corporate governance on the earnings and composition of the firm's 
workforce. I build a new dataset that links over 2,000 public companies 
to their employees in Texas. Focusing on shareholder-sponsored 
proposals, I measure stronger corporate governance using the passage of 
proposals to declassify the board of directors. I find that vote passage
 lowers firm's average employee earnings by 11%, directionally 
consistent with the previous literature. This has often been interpreted
 as wage decreases for individual workers. However, I show that this 
decrease is only due to the changing composition of the workforce. Firms
 shift from higher-earning to lower-earning employees. This evidence 
suggests that stronger corporate governance does not simply cause a 
wealth transfer from employees to shareholders. Instead, it causes real 
changes in the types of employees selected and retained by the firm.</div>

 information between lenders and borrowers is understood to be a key 
friction in credit markets. Perhaps amplified information problems 
explain why the supply of corporate credit contracts in recessions and 
crises. Alternatively, asymmetric information may be reduced by economic
 slowdowns. We test these opposing views of information frictions in the
 credit market using data on lending from a large bank, through two 
business cycles. We find that this banks’ ability to sort borrowers by 
credit quality is best in recessions, and worst in good times. This 
suggests that information frictions are counter-cyclical in corporate 
credit markets.</div>

 analyze the role modernization plays in shaping corporate bond market 
transactions. To empirically identify the effects of technological 
change, we use eligibility cut-off rules from a regulatory reform 
allowing issuers to significantly accelerate issuance speeds. Textual 
analyses of the bond underwriting reveals widespread adoption of 
covenants, which serve a new purpose of simplifying due diligence in 
addition to shifting risk. The costs and benefits of modernization are 
not evenly distributed. Learning externalities from transitioning to 
covenant-heavy bonds coincide with a contract uncertainty premium, which
 benefits institutional investors at the expense of subsequent 
investors. Issuers bear some costs but benefit from an expanded set of 
bondholders. Competition prevents underwriters from profiting. Overall, 
our findings cast doubt on the notion that the transformative power of 
technology helps retail investors.

 various “centrality” measures from Social Network Analysis (SNA), we 
analyze, for the first time in the literature, how the location of a 
lead IPO underwriter in its network of investment banks affects various 
IPO characteristics. We hypothesize that investment banking networks 
allow lead IPO underwriters to induce institutions to pay attention to 
the firms they take public and to perform two information-related roles 
during the IPO process: an information dissemination role, where the 
lead underwriter uses its investment banking network to disseminate 
noisy information about various aspects of the IPO firm to institutional
 investors; and an information extraction role, where the lead 
underwriter uses its investment banking network to extract information 
useful in pricing the IPO firm equity from institutional investors. 
Based on these two roles, we develop testable hypotheses relating lead 
IPO underwriter centrality to the IPO characteristics of firms they take
 public. We find that more central lead IPO underwriters are associated 
with larger absolute values of offer price revisions; greater IPO and 
after-market valuations; larger IPO initial returns; greater 
institutional investor equity holdings and analyst coverage immediately 
post-IPO; greater stock liquidity post-IPO; and better long-run stock 
returns. Using a hand-collected data set of pre-IPO media coverage as a 
proxy for investor attention, we show that an important channel through 
which more central lead IPO underwriters achieve favorable IPO 
characteristics is by attracting greater investor attention to the IPOs 
underwritten by them.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21623_abstract">In
 this paper, we propose an explanation for the prominent role of 
manufacturers in the financing of their own product sales- so called 
“captive finance."  By lending against their own product as collateral, 
durable goods manufacturers with market power can commit to restrict 
production and maintain resale values in future periods, preserving 
rents today.  Using data on captive financing support by the 
manufacturers of heavy equipment, we find evidence that captive financed
 models retain higher resale values, especially when the manufacturer 
has pricing power.  The higher resale values enjoyed by captive financed
 models also convey higher pledgeability and thus allow lower 
downpayments, even when machines are financed by banks.  We find that 
models with a history of captive support are preferred by buyers when 
financing constraints are binding.  Although motivated as a rent-seeking
 device, captive financing may generate positive spillovers if credit 
constraints are important.</div>

 is superior over a single-state model. The dividend term structure 
extrapolates to an implied price-dividend ratio. This model-implied

 index return variation, despite the fast mean reversion to long-run

strong evidence for a small predictable component in consumption growth 
(even if asset return data are omitted from the estimation). Three 
independent volatility processes capture  different frequency dynamics; 
our measurement error specification implies that consumption is measured
 much more precisely at an annual than monthly frequency; and the 
estimated model is able to capture key asset-pricing facts of the data.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20113_abstract">During
 Egypt’s Arab Spring, unprecedented popular mobilization and protests 
brought down
Hosni Mubarak’s government and ushered in an era of competition between 
three groups: elites associated with Mubarak’s National Democratic Party
 (NDP), the military, and the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. Street 
protests continued to play an important role during this power struggle.
 We show that these protests are associated with differential stock 
market returns for firms connected to the three groups. Using daily 
variation in the number of protesters, we document that more intense 
protests in Tahrir Square are associated with lower stock market 
valuations for firms connected to the group currently in power relative 
to non-connected firms, but have no impact on the relative valuations of
 firms connected to other powerful groups. We further show that activity
 on social media may have played an important role in mobilizing 
protesters, but had no direct effect on relative valuations. According 
to our preferred interpretation, these events provide evidence that, 
under weak institutions, popular mobilization and protests have a role 
in restricting the ability of connected firms to capture excess rents.</div>

 contribution is to provide direct evidence that analysts engage in 
costly discovery of private information, and investors value this 
discovery.  The innovation in our paper is to read over 3,700 analyst 
reports from Investext and explicitly identify whether the report 
contains discovery or interpretation.  Analysts discover new information
 by talking to management sources (through personal meetings, investor 
meetings, and conference calls) or non-management sources (such as 
surveys or channel checks, and industry contacts).  We find that 
information discovery is prevalent in 17% of the reports.  For reports 
containing discovery, the average cumulative abnormal returns (over the 
three-day window surrounding the report issuance) are statistically and 
economically significant (5.9% for upgrades and –8.6% for downgrades).  
The cumulative abnormal returns are higher for reports containing 
discovery relative to those containing interpretation.  We find that 
economic determinants predict whether a report will contain discovery.  
Discovery from management sources is more likely for reports in the 
period prior to Regulation FD and for reports by optimistic analysts.  
Discovery from non-management sources is more likely for reports written
 in the period following Regulation FD, for those written by All-Star 
analysts, for firms that have high information asymmetry, and firms 
where the competition among analysts is higher.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21480_abstract">When a risk factor has small covariance with asset returns, risk premia in the linear asset pricing models
are no longer identied. Weak factors, similar to weak instruments, make the usual estimation techniques
unreliable. When included in the model, they generate spuriously high signicance levels of their own risk
premia estimates, overall measures of t and may crowd out the impact of the true sources of risk. I develop
a new approach to the estimation of cross-sectional asset pricing models that : a) provides simultaneous
model diagnostics and parameter estimates; b) automatically removes the effect of spurious factors; c)

the pricing ability of various factors proposed in the literature. In particular, I identify a set of robust

 use a simple accounting based framework to link two primary measures of
 ‘value’ to expected returns for countries: earnings-to-price (E/P) and 
book-to-price (B/P). We document that when earnings are more persistent,
 E/P is close to a sufficient statistic for expected returns. However, 
when earnings are less persistent, B/P is needed. We find that high B/P 
countries are, on average, facing temporarily depressed earnings and 
their recovery in near term earnings growth is uncertain. Countries with
 high B/P also exhibit greater downside sensitivity to contemporaneous 
global earnings growth, which supports our interpretation that B/P 
reflects risky future earnings growth.</div>

 on making a takeover bid, bidders are more likely to offer stock as 
payment for the target when bidder market-to-book ratio (M/B) is high. 
However, when we instrument M/B with aggregate mutual fund flows that 
are exogenous to takeovers, this effect disappears. Moreover, we show 
that stock-payment is more likely when the two firms are geographically 
close and operate in complementary industries, and when the bidder has 
just issued seasoned equity, all of which reduce information asymmetry. 
Bidders paying with stock also tend to be small, non-dividend paying

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21199_abstract">Why
 do firms diversify into unrelated product markets? Internal labor 
markets allow firms to reallocate workers in response to industry 
shocks. They also strengthen workers’ incentives to invest in 
transferable, productivity-enhancing skills. Thus, the transferability 
of human capital can be a source of merger synergies. To test this 
hypothesis, we construct an index of human capital transferability using
 more than 11 million job changes. We show that diversifying 
acquisitions occur more frequently among industry pairs with higher 
transferability. The effect is roughly 1.7 times the size of the effect 
of product market relatedness. Diversifying acquisitions between 
industries with higher human capital transferability result in larger 
labor productivity gains and are less often undone in subsequent 
divestitures. Moreover, firms retain more high skill workers after 
acquiring new industries with high human capital transferability to 
their existing industries and they exploit the real option to move 
workers from the target firm to jobs in other industries inside the 
merged firm. Overall, our results identify the utilization of human 
capital as a source of value from corporate diversification.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13779_abstract">The
 carbon externality from energy consumption in the residential sector is
 an important topic of societal discussion. Much of the current policy 
making hinges on the assumption that markets efficiently capitalize home
 energy performance into transaction prices. However, there is limited 
empirical evidence supporting this assumption. This study uses 
transaction data for a large sample of dwellings to examine the 
capitalization of energy efficiency in the housing market. Using the 
exogenous variation in energy efficiency generated by 1973-74 oil 
crisis, as well as the evolution of building codes as instruments, we 
document that a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency leads to an 
increase in the transaction price by around 11 percent for an average 
home in the Dutch housing market. Our findings indicate that the 
capitalization of energy efficiency does not vary significantly when 
Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) are present. We document that the 
estimated value of energy efficiency varies over time, which might be a 
consequence of fluctuations in house prices, increased energy costs, and
 changing consumer awareness.</div>

 March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. 
This disabled the reactor cooling systems of the Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) that led to releases of radioactivity. The 
Fukushima accident was big news in the United States and it clearly led 
to a reevaluation of nuclear safety. In this paper, we look at how house
 prices around NPPs in the U.S. changed after this event. Because it was
 unanticipated, it can be considered to be an exogenous shock and we can
 isolate changes in prices that were directly tied to the Fukushima 
accident. It is important to note that there was no change in the risk 
of a nuclear accident in the U.S. after Fukushima. We view this is as an
 information shock that led to a reassessment of this risk by residents 
near nuclear power plants. We have data on transactions for 
single-family homes in 2009-2013 that are within 50 kms of 29 NPPs in 
seven states in the U.S. Our results provide some evidence that the 
impact on house prices was very local (within 0-4 kms of a NPP) and of a
 limited duration (around 6 months). This is consistent with polls taken
 in the U.S. that showed a significant drop in those who approved of 
building more NPPs soon after the Fukushima accident but also found a 
significant majority in favor of using nuclear power one year after the 
event.</div>

 the sequential sale of new condominium units in a setting in which both
 consumption risk and completion risk are minimized and where production
 agglomeration does not pertain, this paper provides new evidence on the
 sales price-sales sequence pattern for real estate. The empirical 
results show that the anomalies of declining price “afternoon effect” or
 rising price from increasing relative demand documented in the auction 
literature do not extend to real estate markets. We thus conclude that 
the law of one price appears to hold for real estate assets sold in open

 pricing, estimating the value of housing characteristics through the 
use of transactions data, is one of the most common tasks performed by 
real estate researchers. However, transaction frequency varies over 
time, locations, and other factors. In contrast, two-thirds of 
homeowners have a mortgage that  they pay each month. This manuscript 
explores the use of mortgage payment data as an alternative or 
supplemental means to derive the value of housing characteristics. 
Insofar as price affects
default and housing characteristic values determine price, housing 
characteristic values affect default. The implicit housing 
characteristic values come from parameter values that fit observed 
patterns of payments and defaults.  We find a strong correlation 
($0.74-0.92$) between the explicit and implicit approaches. In addition,
 the Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the mortgage based pricing 
model has potential to help reveal housing market information especially
 during low sales activity and/or high
default rate situations.</div>

 estate agents play an important intermediary role in housing markets. 
We use a merged transaction dataset that identifies houses purchased by 
registered real estate agents (salespersons) and other buyers in 
Singapore to empirically test the hypothesis that real estate agents use
 their information advantages to buy houses at bargained prices. We 
estimate that agents bought their own houses at prices that are 2% lower
 than comparable houses bought by other buyers. After the new regulatory
 regime has come into operation in 2010, agents’ price advantages in 
buying houses for their own use have disappeared. We compare sellers 
with time pressure to sell houses, such as individuals, who sell current
 houses to move into new houses, and distressed sellers affected by 
lawsuits, with investors who sell houses that yield positive returns, 
and find no evidence that agents use their information advantages to 
“cherry pick” houses from the weak sellers. However, our results support
 the bargaining power hypothesis that agents use their information 
advantages to buy their own houses at lower prices from individual

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13828_abstract">Based
 on analyst forecast properties for a large number of REITs, we find 
that information asymmetry is relatively large after REIT IPOs. In 
contrast, information asymmetry is lower around REIT SEOs. This paper 
also provides evidence that REIT analysts tend to be relatively 
pessimistic around SEOs, whereas they tend to be relatively more 
optimistic after an IPO. Our results are independent of REIT type, the 
number of analysts that follow a given REIT, robust for a number of 
multivariate specifications, and continue to hold in a setting which 
controls for possible endogeneity between analyst following and 
performance.</div>

 study examines whether institutional investors exhibit herding behavior
 by property type in real estate investment trusts (REITs). Our analysis
 of changes in institutional portfolio holdings indicates strong 
evidence of this behavior. Most of the autocorrelation in aggregate 
institutional demand is attributed to institutional investors following 
the trades of others. Although momentum trading explains a small amount 
of this herding, institutional property type demand is more strongly 
associated with lagged demand than lagged returns. The results suggest 
that correlated information signals drive herding in REITs. This herding
 occurs at the property type level, and not at the individual firm

 paper examines the relationship between the stock crash risk of REITs 
and different types of institutional investors. First, when we classify 
REIT institutional investors by their legal type, we find that the 
ownership of pension funds (bank trusts) is negatively (positively) 
related to REIT crash risk. In addition, the trading of investment 
companies, including mutual funds, has become positively related to REIT
 crash risk in recent years. Next, when we classify REIT institutional 
investors by their investment behavior, we find that REIT crash risk is 
positively related to the trading of transient institutional  investors,
 which trade frequently to maximize short-term gains. Moreover, the 
adverse impact of transient investors on REIT crash risk has worsened 
recently. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impacts of 
different types of institutional investors on REIT crash risk, which has
 important implications for REIT market participants and policymakers.</div>

 introduce a novel approach to identify the effect of public guarantees 
on market discipline by exploiting the rich variation in U.S. state 
guarantees of property-liability insurer obligations. Our evidence 
suggests that government guarantees significantly reduce the sensitivity
 of premium growth to changes in financial strength ratings, and that 
this reduced sensitivity applies to both price and volume changes. The 
effects are concentrated among insurers rated A- or lower by A.M. Best. 
We find that premium growth in the uncovered business of a downgraded 
insurer falls in relation to growth in its covered business, with the 
estimate of the difference being as high as 15% for A- rated insurers 
and 10% for insurers rated below A-. </div>

 paper tests the effects of independence and financial knowledge of 
directors on risk management and firm value in the gold mining industry.
 Our original hand collected database on directors’ financial education,
 accounting background, and financial experience allows for testing the 
effect of each dimension of financial knowledge on risk management 
activities. We show that directors’ financial knowledge increases the 
value of the firm through the risk management channel. This effect 
strengthens with the independence of directors sitting on the board and 
the audit committee. Extending the dimension of education, we show that 
following unexpected shocks to gold prices educated hedgers are more 
effective than the average hedgers in the industry. As a policy

 large strand of research has identified conditions on preferences under
 which (i) a single risk is undesirable and (ii) two independent risks 
aggravate each other. We extend this line of inquiry by establishing 
conditions such that (iii) the degree of mutual aggravation is greater 
for more severe risks. Here, the severity of risks is characterized by 
means of general stochastic dominance shifts and also via 
moment-preserving stochastic transformations. Greater mutual aggravation
 is implied by all commonly used utility functions and may thus be 
regarded a typical property of expected utility preferences. We show 
that greater mutual aggravation determines the comparative statics of 
risk changes in several risk management problems, including 
precautionary saving, intertemporal risk-taking, and self-protection. 
Greater mutual aggravation further explains recent experimental findings
 on higher-order risk preferences. Finally, it offers a new, simple, and
 efficient method to elicit risk preferences up to "very" high orders.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14065_abstract">We
 analyze the optimal insurance coverage for high severity-low 
probability accidents, both from theoretical and applied standpoints. 
Such accidents qualify as catastrophic when their risk premium is a 
non-negligible proportion of the victims’ wealth, although the 
probability of occurrence is very small. We show that this may be the 
case when the individual’s absolute risk aversion is very large in the 
accident case. We characterize the optimal insurance contract firstly 
for an individual, and secondly for a firm that may be at the origin of 
an accident that affects the whole population. The optimal indemnity 
schedule converges to a limit when the probability of the accident tends
 to zero. In the case of corporate civil liability, this limit schedule 
is a straight deductible contract that corresponds to an indemnification
 of victims ranked in order of priority according to the severity of 
their losses. We also show that the size of the deductible depends on 
the individuals’ risk aversion and also on the cost of contingent risk 
capital that is required to sustain the indemnity payment, should an 
accident occur. The empirical part of the paper is an application of 
these general principles to the case of nuclear accidents. Large scale 
nuclear accidents are typical examples of high severity-low probability 
risks. We calibrate a model on French data in order to estimate the 
optimal liability ceiling of an electricity producer in the nuclear 
energy sector. We use data drawn from the cat-bond markets to estimate 
the cost of contingent capital for low probability events, and we show 
that the minimal corporate liability adopted in 2004 through the 
revision of the Paris Convention is probably lower than the level that 
would correspond to an optimal risk coverage of the population.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13918_abstract">While
 many scholars have examined whether politicians favor core or swing 
supporters during normal politics, we examine these competing logics 
during an economic crisis when governments face especially hard choices.
 We use new fiscal data from 83 regions in Russia during the economic 
crisis of 2008-2010 to explore two types of redistribution: social 
transfers and targeted investment funds. In line with core voter models,
 we find that regions more supportive of United Russia during elections 
received greater social transfers and more targeted investment funds 
than other regions. During the financial crisis politically loyal 
regions were even more richly rewarded. Thus, while economic crises 
often overturn patterns of economic redistribution, the economic crisis 
of 2008--10 in Russia reinforced them. These results are informative 
given the frequency of economic crisis in lower and middle-income 
countries and the ongoing debate over the impact of elections on policy 
in hybrid and authoritarian governments.</div>

 provides an event of prime interest to investigate the influence of 
state-owned banks on political outcomes with the ascending to power of 
Vladimir Putin in 1999 and in 2000. During this period, the state-owned 
bank Sberbank had a dominating market share throughout the country. The 
aim of our project is to investigate whether Sberbank lending has been 
used as a political instrument to influence the outcome of the Russian 
elections of March 2000. To study this question, we analyze the relation
 between the regional variation in Sberbank loans and the regional 
variation in Putin’s popularity. We test two hypotheses. First, we 
examine if Sberbank lending has increased in the months preceding 
elections in an attempt to boost Putin’s popularity.  Second, we 
investigate if greater Sberbank lending has been observed in the months 
after elections to reward regions that performed well in the election 
with loans from government banks. To investigate this issue, we use 
monthly data for regional Sberbank lending activities. The “carrot” 
hypothesis is examined by considering the variation in Sberbank loans in
 the three months prior to the presidential elections of March 2000. The
 “reward” hypothesis is investigated by looking at the variation in 
Sberbank loans between March 2000 and December 2000. We relate these 
pre- and post-election regional changes in Sberbank lending to the 
regional change in Putin’s popularity.</div>

 paper explores an almost untouched topic in the fast-growing climate 
econometrics literature – the implications of climate change for 
government expenditures. Using a rich sub-national dataset for Russia 
covering 1995–2009, we estimate the impacts of climate change through 
short-term weather variation and medium-term changes in average regional
 temperatures and precipitation. We show a strong and robust negative 
(but non-linear) relation between regional budget expenditures and 
population-weighted temperature. The results indicate that an increase 
in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures and that the
 magnitude of this effect diminishes the warmer the region. Further, our
 results suggest that the benefits from warming accumulate and that 
adaptation measures could help leverage those benefits. The estimated 
decreases in public expenditure are, however, quite small. In mild 
warming scenarios, according to our estimates Russia saves roughly USD 
3-4 billion in regional government expenditures between 2000 and the 
2020s without undertaking adaptation measures, depending on the 
scenario. It should be noted that our results are estimated for a 
scenario of mild temperature increase (1-2 °C). Larger temperature 
increases are likely to have dramatic consequences e.g. from loss of 
permafrost and methane release that are impossible to predict with 
available historical data.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13921_abstract">Russia’s
 Far East (RFE) has been traditionally one of the most isolated and 
economically disadvantaged parts of Russia. The revival of traditional 
trade and investment links with Northeast Asia, the economic emergence 
of neighboring China, and a recent policy drive by the federal 
government aimed at promoting growth in the region leave the impression 
that RFE is on the rise. For instance, exports to China, Japan, and 
Korea are five times larger than to the rest of Russia implying that RFE
 appears to be better integrated within Northeast Asia than within 
Russia. We test this hypothesis by using new data on interregional and 
cross-border trade in Russia to estimate a gravity model for the period 
2005-2012. In particular, we estimate the effects of borders on trade by
 comparing interregional trade among the nine RFE regions with trade 
between RFE and the rest of Russia and between RFE and China. Our 
results indicate that after accounting for distance and contiguity trade
 within RFE is three times larger than trade with the rest of Russia. 
The tariff equivalent of the border between RFE and Russia is 14%, which
 is significantly lower than the 46% for the border between RFE and 
China. Interestingly, the regions that border China exhibit higher 
border effects than those further inland. These findings suggest that 
given their proximity, RFE’s trade with China should be far more 
intensive. The determinants of the trade barriers that prevent this from
 happening are explored using regression analysis and are identified 
mainly as poor cross-border infrastructure, limited scope for policy 
making at the regional level, and haphazard tax policies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14286_abstract">The
 period since circa 1980 has been widely recognized as one of 
financialisation. A previous period of financialisation culminated in 
the financial crashes of 1929 and the early 1930s, followed by a period 
of definancialisation, and after World War II financialisation returned,
 and intensified circa 1980. Financialisation in the recent era has 
involved the growth of the size of banks and of financial markets, 
development of financial instruments including derivatives and 
securitisation, de-regulation, the ownership of corporations by 
financial institutions and the pursuit of ‘shareholder value’, 
privatisation and de-mutualisation of the financial sector etc.. 
Financialisation has developed at different speeds and in different 
forms across the globe. Many researchers have pointed to deleterious 
effects on the economy and society of these processes. Based on the 
research in the Financialisation Economy Society and Sustainable Devel! 
opment project, we address three questions. First, what policies should 
be adopted towards the financial sector to construct a sector which 
better serves people and society? We propose measures such as 
re-mutualisation of the financial sector, development of State banks, 
financial transactions taxes directed to reducing the deleterious 
effects of financialisation through elements of de-financialisation. 
Second, as financialisation involves greater economic and political 
power of the financial sector, how politically feasible are policies of 
definancialisation? Third, the period since circa 1980 has been 
perceived in terms of financialised capitalism as a stage of capitalism,
 the question is posed on how such policies would relate to such a view.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14287_abstract">This
 paper studies the deterioration of working households’ balance sheets 
result from rising income inequality and its impact on the 
sustainability of growth. It addresses the question of how “group 
inequalities ... influence sustainable development” identified under 
“Financialization and inequalities” in the ASA-ASSA 2016 call for 
papers. According to Setterfield and Kim (2013) and Setterfield et al 
(2014), in the presence of emulation effects in consumption behavior and
 uncertainty about the long-term consequences of debt accumulation, 
rising income inequality can boost growth but simultaneously undermine 
the sustainability of the growth process. The proposed paper will extend
 this earlier work so that it involves international comparisons. It is 
well known that the epicenters of the Great Recession were the US and 
UK, two “liberal market economies” (Hall and Soskice, 2001) where 
neoliberalism was most advanced and where increases in income inequality
 have been most pronounced over the last thirty-five years. This is 
certainly suggestive of a link between increased income inequality and 
the eventual breakdown of steady growth. But the precise nature of this 
link would be made clearer if events in a representative liberal market 
economy (such as the US) were compared and contrasted with those in a 
“coordinated market economy” (Hall and Soskice, 2001) such as Germany. 
As such, the key question addressed in this paper is: relative to the 
liberal market economies, were there limits to increases in inequality 
in coordinated market economies, and was the growth process robust to 
the increases in inequality that the! se economies experienced?</div>

 term ‘financialisation’ has now entered the lexicon of academics and 
policy makers, though there is still no agreement on its meaning and 
significance. One of the earlier definitions was offered by Epstein 
(2005; see also Krippner, 2005) when he refers to the growing weight of 
financial motives, financial actors and markets in the operation of 
modern economies, both at the national and international level, from the
 early 1980s until today. Building on this definition, this paper 
provides a reassessment of European monetary integration and European 
Central Bank interest rate policy, which has been associated with 
divergent economic development and over recent years to severe 
core-periphery financial imbalances.</div>

 literature in social sciences on identity, stratification, and 
intersectionality has long shown the importance of group identity in 
explaining the persistence of income inequality over time. However, 
methodological individualism and marginalism in economics mean that 
income inequality is still assessed from the perspective of the 
individual. By taking a group perspective to individuals, the 
contribution of this paper is to statistically define ethical and 
unethical earnings according to the nature of the long-run process of 
group’s earnings vis-à-vis others. The paper thus presents a long-run 
methodology to uncover ethical and unethical earnings and applies it to 
the US labour force by race and gender between 1968 and 2011 on the one 
hand, and to the UK labour force by race and gender between 2001 and 
2014 on the other hand. Results show that rent-seeking behaviour is a 
group phenomenon which extends to most of the US and UK labour force, 
with strong group and occupational disparities.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14290_abstract">The
 Eurozone has a unique monetary policy and commercial banks fix the 
loans interest rate by following the same mark-up rule: they add a 
mark-up on the short-run nominal interest rate set by the European 
Central Bank (ECB). However, empirical evidence shows that there are 
significant differentials in the interest rates that borrowers face in 
the core and periphery countries of the Eurozone. Furthermore, it can be
 shown that these differential interest rates are influenced by the 
insolvency rate of domestic firms as well as the effects of national 
fiscal policies (source: Creditreform, Eurostat). Drawing on the 
Monetary Theory of Production approach this paper shows that the mark-up
 set by national commercial banks over the short-run nominal interest 
rate set by the ECB depends positively on the way in which financial 
markets and financial actors perceive credit risks, which in turns 
positively depend on the liquidity risk and insolvency risk. The paper 
shows that expansionary fiscal policies could help to reduce these 
credit risks and hence alleviate the differential interest rates faced 
by borrowers in core and periphery countries of the Eurozone.</div>

 estimate the responsiveness of charitable donations to tax incentives 
using an administrative panel of UK income tax returns with 9 millions 
observations per year for the period 2005-2012. We exploit a large 
reform in the UK Income Tax schedule which reduced the price of giving 
by 16% (up to 33% for a small group of taxpayers). Using an IV empirical
 strategy, we estimate that the intensive-margin price elasticity of 
giving is -0.45, significantly different from both 0 and -1. An 
alternative estimation using a consistent Tobit estimator with fixed 
effects yields an elasticity around -0.25. Additionally, we estimate the
 heterogeneity in the elasticity of giving across gender, income level 
and size of donations. Our results suggest that tax incentives for 
charitable donations in the UK are unlikely to be welfare-maximizing, 
since the loss in tax collection is higher than the increase in private 
donations due to this policy. Exploiting a unique feature of the UK 
Income Tax, we provide a lower bound for the avoidance response due to 
shifting donations across years.</div>

 estimation of the tax-price elasticity of charitable giving has 
traditionally been a canonical area of interest in the economics 
profession.  However, there is currently no consensus as to what this 
elasticity is, and in the past decade work on this topic has been 
largely abandoned.  We explore the importance of tax incentives for 
giving by focusing on a state-level income tax-credit in Indiana that 
creates a convex kink in the budget constraint of donors.  Using a 
dataset of over 800,000 donations, we compute estimates of the 
compensated elasticity of giving using standard kink methods; we also 
show that bunching at a kink can be used to directly uncover the 
uncompensated elasticity as well.  We find evidence of bunching from the
 tax credit, but the implied uncompensated elasticity is relatively 
small, about 0.5 or less.</div>

 paper estimates the effect of the charitable contribution tax deduction
 on charities' donation revenue from charities' tax filings. A one 
percent increase in the tax cost of giving causes charitable receipts to
 fall by about four percent, an effect three times larger the consensus

 the tax response by subsector: health care and home care are more 
tax-sensitive than other charities, while higher education and arts are 
less tax-sensitive. The results are consistent with substantial tax 
response heterogeneity within the sample and between sampled and

 syphilis can be prevented effectively and treated inexpensively, it 
remains a global public health problem.  Untreated congenital syphilis 
results in neonatal death, preterm birth, or congenital deformities.  
Many developing countries have recently instituted syphilis prevention 
programs in antenatal care, but there has not been a systematic study of
 the short and long-term effects of such programs.  This paper is the 
first to study antenatal testing laws initiated in the U.S. in 1938-1947
 which mandated physicians and others attending to pregnant women to 
test them for syphilis.  In a companion paper (Fung and Robles 2015), we
 use the variation in the timing of state antenatal testing laws to 
estimate the laws’ effect on neonatal mortality. We find that these laws
 decreased neonatal mortality rates of nonwhites while having no 
discernible impact on whites. We also find that mandatory antenatal 
testing led to an increase in the cohort size of nonwhite poor. In this 
paper, we follow up our initial result to study the long-term effects of
 mandatory antenatal testing. Using the 1970 March Current Population 
Surveys, we examine the propensity for progression to high school, 
unemployment, and underage marriage among the treated cohorts.  We find 
that while the laws prevented neonatal mortality, the preserved 
offspring faced risks common to those born to disadvantaged households. 
 We also study the laws’ impact on crime rates 16 years later (the age 
at which prevalence for violent crime starts to increase rapidly) and 
unskilled wages 30 years later.  Using data from the 1949-1968 Uniform 
Crime Reports and the 1964-1980 March Current Population Surveys, we 
find an increase in violent crime rates and a reduction in unskilled 
wages among the treated cohorts.</div>

 analysis of skilled migration flows and their economic impact requires

Unfortunately, such complete datasets do not exist. We focus on African

example to highlight these issues and identify key patterns in their 
career paths. We overcome data constraints by merging data from the 
American Medical Association (AMA) and American Community Survey (ACS) 
via propensity score matching techniques. Our results show that the 
standard assumptions on skilled migration lead to considerable 
overestimation of its extent and hide several economically important 
migration patterns. We find that almost half of African-born doctors 
were trained outside their birth country. On the flip side, around 15 
percent of all doctors trained in Africa were actually born outside the 
continent. There is significant variation across countries in terms of 
age of migration levels, implying that many African doctors migrate 
after years of service and that their human capital is not completely 
lost to their birth countries. In short, global labor and education 
markets for high-skilled professionals are integrated in more nuanced 
and thought-provoking ways than assumed in the literature.</div>

 unexploited scientific models of pollution processes can be used to 
isolate powerful and geographically widespread variation in airborne 
pollution for the purposes of uncovering causal estimates of health 
effects. I simulate the geographic distribution over time of fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) caused by wildfires for the entire 
continental United States during 2004-2010 using a set of scientific 
models of wildfire emissions and air pollution transport commonly used 
wildfire and air quality applications. Regressing observed 
concentrations of PM2.5 at pollution monitoring stations on simulated 
PM2.5 from wildfires, I find that wildfires can explain at least 15 
percent of ambient ground-level PM2.5 and even larger fractions of toxic
 mercury and lead particulates. I regress county-level health outcomes 
on station-measured PM2.5 using simulated wildfire PM2.5 as an 
instrumental variable, finding that a 10μgm-3 (approximately 2.3 
standard deviation) increase in monthly PM2.5 concentration is 
associated with one additional premature death per 100,000 individuals. 
This effect is driven primarily by deaths from cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases for individuals over age 65. With a control 
function approach, I find evidence that dose response is approximately 
linear below the U.S. ambient air quality standard for PM2.5. In 
addition, in-utero exposure to PM2.5 is associated with higher rates of 
prematurity, lower birth weights, and changes in the sex ratio, which I 
interpret as evidence of fetal attrition. Finally, the estimated health 
effects of PM2.5 are sensitive to the inclusion of controls for other 
pollutants, likely reflecting changes in the underlying conditional 
local average treatment effect. I present suggestive evidence that these
 changes are driven by heterogeneous health risks per unit mass of the 
chemical subcomponents of total PM2.5 mass, with metallic particulates 
far more dangerous than organic particulates. These findings contribute 
to a growing body of evidence on the health dangers of fine particulate 
matter.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14366_abstract">We
 exploit random daily variation in weather, to document the relationship
 of temperature, rainfall, and snowfall with traffic accidents and 
travel demand. Using information on 46.5 million accidents from the 
State Data System of police reported accidents for 20 states and travel 
demand for 207,455 households included in the National Household 
Transportation Survey, we find unanticipated effects of weather on 
accidents and their severity. Our estimates suggest that warmer 
temperatures and reduced snowfall are associated with a moderate decline
 in non-fatal accidents, but there is a significant increase in fatal 
accidents. This increase in fatalities is due to a robust positive 
relationship between fatalities and temperature.

The nature of our data allows us to test potential mechanisms that may 
be driving the results. We show that exposure is important but not the 
only factor in fatalities. Slightly less than half of the estimated 
effect of temperature is due to changes in the exposure to pedestrians, 
bicyclists, and motorcyclists as temperatures increase. We are unable to
 attribute the remaining effect to demographic compositional changes, 
alcohol, or drug use. Consistent with the Peltzman effect, we find that 
drivers seem to respond to increased accident risk with behavioral 
changes including reduced demand for travel on days with extreme 
temperature and precipitation. Moreover, we show that heat, as opposed 
to extreme cold or precipitation is the only inclement weather factor 
that makes a fatality more likely conditional on having an accident.

The application of these results to middle-of-the-road climate 
predictions suggests that weather patterns from 2100 would lead to 667 
additional fatalities and costs of more than $3 billion annually. While 
adaptation may reduce these costs, we find no evidence that this 
relationship has changed over between 1980 and 2010 or between hot and 
cold regions of the country.</div>

heating with violent crime, we find that high temperatures are 
nonlinearly associated with increases in the murder rate. Consistent 
with the literature suggesting a causal link between poverty and crime, 
we find that climate conditions associated with low crop yields increase
 rates of property crimes. Lastly, we document the novel result that 
property crime rates increase the year following tropical cyclone 
impact, consistent with prior evidence suggesting that cyclones' poverty
 effects are substantial but take time to emerge. Our findings establish
 that climate variability can influence crime rates through multiple 
distinct economic and noneconomic channels in a middle-income country, 
and in particular supports both the growing consensus that high 
temperature increase rates of interpersonal violence as well as a causal
 interpretation of poverty’s positive association with property crime.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14368_abstract">This
 paper provides novel evidence from a contemporary developing countries 
on the causal relationship between weather, income, and crime over large
 spatial and temporal scales. Using detailed crime and weather data from
 India during the years 1971-2000, we show that weather shocks that 
reduce agricultural output, low rainfall and high temperatures, increase
 most types of crimes. These effects are larger and more uniform for 
property crimes than for violent crimes. Moreover, when these weather 
shocks occur outside the main cultivation season, they do not affect 
crime. These patterns are consistent with economic models of crime, and 
suggest agricultural income shocks to be driving the weather-crime 
relationship. Despite the significant economic changes taking place in 
India during these years, and even though the incidence of crime has in 
general declined, the effect of weather shocks on crime has remained 
remarkably stable.</div>

 increases the overlap of bank loan portfolios and makes them more 
vulnerable to contagious effects. We develop a novel measure of bank 
interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loans.  Interconnectedness
 is positively related to both bank size and diversification; 
diversification, however, matters more than size. We find a positive 
correlation between interconnectedness and various bank-level systemic 
risk measures including SRISK, CoVaR, and DIP that arises from an 
elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during 
recessions. Using a market-level measure of systemic risk, CATFIN, we

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14577_abstract">We
 propose a new theory of systemic risk based on Knightian uncertainty 
(or "ambiguity"). We show that, due to uncertainty aversion, beliefs on 
future asset returns are endogenous, and bad news on one asset class 
induces investors to be more pessimistic about other asset classes as 
well. This means that idiosyncratic risk can create contagion and 
snowball into systemic risk. Furthermore, in a Diamond and Dybvig (1983)
 setting, we show that, surprisingly, uncertainty aversion causes 
investors to be less prone to run individual banks, but runs will be 
systemic. In addition, we show that bank runs are associated with stock 
market crashes and flight to quality. Finally, we argue that increasing 
uncertainty makes the financial system more fragile and more prone to 
crises. We conclude with implications for the current public policy 
debate on the management of financial crisis.</div>

trend growth of output (acceleration or deceleration). Using this 
measure, we then reevaluate the relationship between growth and economic
 institutions within the growth episode framework, using separate

Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) guarantees a
maximum of 100 days of work for the rural poor at a government stipulated wage in
a public works scheme. Although the very intent of this programme is to benefit the
poor, it was criticized for its formidable payment delay. A surprising stylized fact is
that such a payment lag raises the participation of poor in the programme instead
of lowering it. In this paper, we argue that a payment delay could seriously hurt
the poor which may not be seen from the usual index of success of the programme
which is participation. Asset-poor households may participate more in response to
such a payment lag. This happens because a payment delay makes labour a credit
good. The household discounts its future labour income more due to a longer
payment lag. This depresses the annuity value of the labour income flow creating
an adverse wealth e¤ect. Since leisure is a normal good, households consume less
leisure and work harder in response to a longer payment delay. A programme of
financial inclusion is likely to increase indebtedness and the borrowing rate facing
the households, compounding the adverse wealth effect on the poor. Since welfare
depends negatively on labour supply, a greater MGNREGS participation may entail
a welfare loss to the rural households. We suggest that reduction of the payment
lag in MGNREGS before implementing the financial inclusion programme is likely
to improve the efficacy of both programmes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13955_abstract">Background:
 Farmers’ suicides have become an important socio-economic concern in 
India that has profound implication on the quality of life of farmers 
and their families. There are not many epidemiological studies on this. 
We propose to estimate suicide rates for farmers and non-farmers across 
the states of India and over time. We will also contextualise our 
results to the discourse on agricultural technology and development in 
general and that of cotton farming in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
Methods: Suicide rates are computed per 100,000 people using suicide 
incidences for farmers and non-farmers reported by the National Crime 
Records Bureau (NCRB) from 1995 to 2012 and normalising the same with 
age-adjusted interpolated/extrapolated population computed from 
census.&lt;br /&gt;
Findings: At the aggregate all India level, one observes that the SDR 
for male farmers increases to a peak in 2004 and there is a second spike
 in 2009 but then it declines and also becomes lower than the suicide 
rates for male non-farmers in 2011 and 2012. However, state-specific 
analysis, while showing mixed pattern, indicates that the decline in 
recent years is largely on account of an abrupt drop in Chhattisgarh on 
account of changes in reporting and non-reporting of farmers’ suicides 
for West Bengal in 2012. The states of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra 
with large cotton-growing areas and with relatively higher incidence of 
farmers’ suicides, in contrast to the all India trend, show an 
increasing trend in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;
Interpretation: Relatively higher incidence of farmers’ suicides is 
symptomatic of risk and raises livelihood as also public health concerns
 among the population dependent on agriculture. Public policy should 
focus on livelihood-enhancing and sustainable agricultural practices. 
Public health interventions should address the need for mental health 
care, reduce response time to lower harm and prevent deaths from 
poisoning and other self-inflicted harm, and restrict and regulate the 
access to and use of organophosphorous poisons. We also call for 
shifting the development discourse linked to farmers’ suicides from a 
techno-centric yield or income focus to a people-centric livelihood and 
quality of life focus.</div>

 are the days when the only branded footwear Indians knew was Bata. 
After years of economic liberalization, one finds many firms; local, 
national, and international jostling for consumer attention by producing
 various types of footwear in Indian market. In fact, today Indian 
footwear industry is the second largest in the world. This market can be
 described as a stylized case of a monopolistically competitive market 
where there is intense competition among firms manufacturing 
differentiated products. In this study, we focus our attention on men’s 
formal shoes which are distinguished by the presence (or absence) of 
many differentiated attributes such as heel, toes, colour, surface, 
laces, buckles and brands. Invoking hedonic price analysis and bid and 
offer curves of the customers and firms respectively, shoe prices are 
viewed as the sum total of the valuation of each of the shoe attributes.
 We estimate the relative valuation of the shoe attributes by regressing
 market prices of shoes on various quality attributes.  Analysis shows 
that shoes made of leather, shiny surface, buckles, laces, and brands 
carry a premium and differentiation based on colour, pointed toes, high 
heels, and texture is not important. In a highly competitive market, 
such data driven studies can provide pointers to firms in altering 
existing shoe models and successfully launching newer ones.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13957_abstract">This
 paper studies the threshold effects of fiscal incentives determined by 
sales-turnover in small-scale enterprises in Indian manufacturing.  
India’s industrial protection and promotion policies for small-scale 
enterprises have figured prominently in the literature on 
industrialization policies in developing countries. These enterprise 
size dependent policies have continued their prominence in recent years 
of India’s shift to market-oriented strategies of development. Size 
dependent labour regulations have attracted most attention as they 
argued to restrict firm-size expansion and employment growth. Empirical 
analyses of fiscal policy rules that incentivize firms to indulge in 
horizontal subcontracting or product outsourcing have been absent. These
 size dependent tax incentives could be equally important in encouraging
 fragmentation of production and prevent natural up-scaling of firm 
sizes. The present paper is perhaps the first attempt at capturing the 
effects of size dependent excise tax incentives in Indian manufacturing.
 The study is based on a large unbalanced panel of manufacturing 
factories in the formal sector covering 25 states and 5 union 
territories of India spanning the period 1998-2008.  Mean subcontracting
 intensity was found to be significantly high in the enterprise-size 
group eligible for excise-tax exemption with turnover below Indian 
Rupees 50 million. The preliminary econometric results indicate that 
size-dependent effects are significant in labor-intensive industries and
 in Indian states classified as inflexible in terms of labor 
regulations. In brief the empirical results supported the threshold 
effects of size dependent fiscal incentives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13986_abstract">As
 more countries adopt policies like carbon taxes and/or carbon cap and 
trade, there is an urgent need to re-examine the economic growth-carbon 
emissions nexus and the mediating role of carbon pricing policy.   Can 
developing economies sustain their economic growth in order to alleviate
 poverty and yet maintain a low carbon intensity economy on a per-capita
 basis?      
Globally, 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions have implemented
 or are scheduled to implement carbon-pricing instruments, including 
emissions trading systems and taxes. (See Figure 1). The world’s 
emissions trading schemes are valued at about $30 billion, with China 
now housing the world's second largest carbon market, covering the 
equivalent of 1,115 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The World 
Bank Group and others are encouraging countries, sub-national 
jurisdictions, and companies to join a growing coalition of first movers
 supporting carbon pricing. In recent years, cap and trade has commanded
 most of the attention in discussions relating to the Kyoto Protocol or 
connected with state-level climate policy efforts in the U.S.  The Obama
 Administration has also supported cap and trade policies over taxation.
  But, what works better from the perspective of economic growth – 
carbon taxes or carbon cap and trade policies? The objective of this 
paper is to examine the impact of carbon pricing, specifically carbon 
cap and trade and carbon taxes, on economic growth and carbon emissions 
for a panel of countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21882_abstract">The
 Catholic Church was the most important economic institution in Western 
Europe until the 16th century. The Protestant Reformation, beginning 
with Luther's posting of his 95 theses in 1517, not only reduced the 
Church's social and political standing, but also was a major economic 
shock. We document the effects of the Reformation on the pattern of 
economic activity in early modern Germany. We first present evidence on 
the closure of monasteries across space and time. We then study changes 
in human capital investments, the reallocation of labor, and the 
resulting shift in economic activity from the church sector toward 
secular economic activities. We find that following the Reformation, 
university degrees were less often taken in theology, the study of which
 was strongly associated with jobs in the Catholic Church; jobs as monks
 were significantly less common among the university-trained; more 
generally, the frequency of church-related occupations declined, while 
the frequency of occupations in education, culture, and government 
administration increased. As a summary measure of the allocation of 
resources, we examine construction activity by sector: we find using 
highly disaggregated data that the rate of new construction activity 
within the church sector declined in Germany after 1517, while 
construction in the secular sector increased. The reallocation of 
economic activity away from the Catholic Church (and church uses more 
generally) marked the decline of Europe's most powerful economic 
institution and was a prominent component of Europe's modernization and 
secularization.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21761_abstract">In
 a multi-country world, currencies do not move in isolation, and 
competitors’ exchange rate movements may help or hurt an exporting firm.
 Motivated by this fact, I construct a multi-country model to examine 
how export prices are affected by movements in own-currency and 
cross-currency exchange rates. Own-currency appreciations move firms 
along the demand curve while cross-currency appreciations shift the 
position of the demand curve. Both affect the price elasticity of demand
 and therefore the degree to which exchange rate movements affect 
prices. When own- and cross-currency appreciations are correlated, the 
exporter changes price in response to both. In the empirical section, I 
employ monthly data and provide estimates of own and cross exchange rate
 pass-through to the price of exports from Canada to the U.S. The cross 
exchange rate pass-through is found to exist in about one-third of 
sample sectors.</div>

 frictions are often invoked to explain low levels of international 
trade beyond those that measured trade frictions (tariffs, 
transportation costs, etc.) can explain. But to explain why 
international trade is lower then domestic trade, home firms have to 
know something that foreigners do not. Without information asymmetry, 
domestic trade and foreign trade would be inhibited equally. This paper 
incorporates a simple information asymmetry  in a standard, two-country 
Armington trade model and studies its effect on international risk 
sharing and trade flows.  We find that ameliorating information 
asymmetry -- information globalization -- reduces trade and 
international risk sharing. In other words, asymmetric information 
frictions behave in the opposite manner as a standard trade cost.</div>

 upon a standard New Keynesian DSGE, we propose an explanation for two 
empirical findings in the international finance literature. First, the

depreciation matches interest differentials --- is rejected much more 
strongly at short horizons than at long. Second, even at long horizons, 
the unbiasedness hypothesis tends to be rejected when one of the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21851_abstract">Can
 temporary subsidies to the industrial sector in an agricultural economy
 jump start a self-sustaining process of industrialization? This paper 
tests this hypothesis by examining the long-run effects of a unique 
industrialization campaign in China in the 1960s, known as the “Third 
Front Movement”. The Movement intended to establish industrial clusters 
in Western China, whose economy by then was predominantly agricultural. 
Motivated by national defense considerations, industrial plants 
established during this period were purposefully located in rugged areas
 far from existing industrial centers. By the time China started its 
market reform in the industrial sector in the 1980s, some local 
economies in the region had sophisticated industrial sectors while some 
otherwise similar places remained predominantly agricultural. This 
unique design lends us credibly exogenous variation to identify the 
effects of temporary industrial subsidies. We evaluate the effects of 
industrial presence on the eve of market reform on local economic 
development over two subsequent decades. Various empirical approaches, 
including case studies, synthetic control method, and pooled regressions
 controlling for a rich set of initial conditions, all yield similar 
results. Places that received large industrial investment during the 
Third Front Movement persisted to have higher levels of urbanization, 
industrialization and human capital in the post-reform era. The effects 
are mainly driven by the fast-growing non-state sector. Increased 
urbanization rates are mainly driven by workers transitioning from the 
agricultural sector to the urban sector within the local economy. 
Industrial linkages are able to explain a quarter of the total effect.</div>

 study the allocation of workers in Mexico across two occupations: 
wage-working and entrepreneurship. Is the assignment of talent optimal? 
Specifically, I examine whether micro-entrepeneurs would earn more if 
they worked for someone else for a wage instead of running their firm. I
 assume that workers care about the non-pecuniary benefits of 
entrepreneurship and that they are heterogeneous in their skills and 
preferences, and apply the generalized Roy model to control for 
selection on unobservables. I use a unique cross-section of full-time 
full-year male workers in urban areas, and estimate the return to 
entrepreneurship for the average entrepreneur. I compute earnings 
differentials using entrepreneurial profits net from capital returns to 
focus exclusively on the allocation of talent. The dataset includes the 
reservation wage for the entrepreneurs, which I use to explicitly 
incorporate the non-pecuniary benefits of running a business in the 
estimation, not only in the selection equation but also as an outcome. I
 observe whether the worker reportedly entered entrepreneurship 
involuntarily and run the generalized Roy model separately for the 
voluntary entrepreneurs and the self- reported necessity entrepreneurs. I
 then compute for each group the average monetary treatment-on- 
the-treated and the full treatment-on-the-treated, which adds the value 
of the non-pecuniary benefits and costs of owning a business to the 
monetary treatment-on-the-treated. I compare the monetary return to the 
full return to study the importance of both non-pecuniary benefits and 
necessity in the occupational choice.</div>

 firms in developing countries are typically modeled as facing a 
frictionless market for workers, characterized by low search costs, full
 information, and a lack of regulation. We report the results of a field
 experiment that randomly placed unemployed young people as apprentices 
with small firms in Ghana. The program provided a novel worker screening
 technology to firms (in addition to simply reducing search costs), as 
(voluntary) participation included non-monetary costs for unemployed 
young people applying to the program. We find that firms that were 
offered apprentices by the program hired and retained them for at least 
six months (the end of our study window). Secondly, each assigned 
apprentice is associated with monthly increases of approximately 25 USD 
in revenue and 10 USD in profits (about 7-10% of baseline). Together, 
these findings suggest the presence of economically significant search 
costs in our context. Moreover, we present strong suggestive evidence of
 substantial heterogeneity in these returns as a function of 
(unobserved) worker ability. This final result highlights the importance
 of screening in firms’ hiring decisions, and echoes the widespread use 
of an entry fee mechanism to hire apprentices in our baseline labor 
market. A simple model in which productivity differences associated with
 worker ability necessitate costly screening can predict the impacts of 
our program. Our findings have implications for understanding labor 
markets in low-income countries, and in particular suggest that high 
youth unemployment in developing economies could be the result, at least
 in part, of substantial labor market frictions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21854_abstract">This
 paper tests whether frictions in factor and financial markets interact 
to constrain the growth of firms and farms in developing countries. If 
firms or farms face constraints on labor or land, then relaxing 
financial frictions will cause the shadow prices of these inputs to 
rise. This will show up as increases in the marginal revenue products of
 these inputs relative to inputs that do not face factor market 
frictions. I take this observation to two randomized experiments that 
relaxed financial frictions to varying degrees for firms in Sri Lanka 
and farms in Ghana. I calculate marginal revenue products by assuming a 
Cobb-Douglas production function. I find that the treatments led to 
significant increases in the shadow wage in both settings and the shadow
 price of land for farms in Ghana. These distortions were greatest for 
treatments that relaxed financial frictions the most. Using a novel 
production function estimation approach and overidentification test, I 
fail to reject the Cobb-Douglas assumption. I conclude that frictions in
 factor markets may diminish the impact of microcredit and 
microinsurance, as well as other interventions designed to spur firm and
 farm growth.</div>

 a recent paper, Guvenen et al. (2015), we have shown the distribution 
of earnings shocks to be extremely leptokurtic, meaning that most

In this paper, we study the effects of these higher-order moments in 
earnings risk on portfolio choice and wealth inequality. We first show 
how to incorporate higher-order moments in incomplete markets model by 
developing a new approximation method for earnings risk. We then embed 
this approximation in a quantitative life-cycle model featuring liquid 
and illiquid assets and study the implications of high kurtosis. Our 
preliminary results suggest that households prefer to allocate more of 
their wealth to illiquid assets if shocks follow a leptokurtic 
distribution. These findings have important implications for the degree 
of consumption insurance against earnings shocks.</div>

 entry of married women into the labor force and the rise in women’s 
relative wages are amongst the most notable economic developments of the
 twentieth century. These phenomena were particularly pronounced in the 
1970s and 1980s, when participation of married women grew from 38% in 
1975 to a peak of 60% in 1996 and the male to female ratio in hourly 
wages dropped from 1.60 to 1.34. Since the early 1990s, the growth in 
these indicators has stalled, especially for college graduates. In this 
paper, we link the decline in the growth in married women’s 
participation and relative wages since the early 1990s to the 
acceleration in the rise of the skill premium starting in those years. 
Our hypothesis is that the growth in wages for highly educated men 
generated a negative wealth effect on the labor supply of their female 
spouses, reducing their labor supply and their wages relative to men. 
Disaggregated evidence on relative wages and labor force participation 
of wives by education and income of the husband provides descriptive 
support for this mechanism. We develop a model of household labor supply
 which can qualitatively reproduce a negative effect on wives’ 
participation of a rise in husbands’ earnings. We show that a calibrated
 version of the model can account for a large fraction of the decline 
relative to trend in married women’s participation in 1995-2005, for 
college educated women and women married to college husbands. The model 
can also account for the rise in the gender wage gap for college 
graduates relative to trend in the same period.</div>

 paper studies how the dynamic pricing of tasks in the “gig” economy 
influences the supply of labor. A large economic literature has explored
 labor supply when workers can flexibly choose how long to work each 
day. In a study of taxi drivers, Camerer et al. (1997) claim that 
drivers quit when they hit a daily income target, consequently driving 
less when hourly earnings are high. If general, this behavior would 
undermine the benefits of emerging “sharing economy” markets where tasks
 are dynamically priced. In this paper, we study how driver-partners on 
the Uber platform respond to the dynamic pricing of trips, known as 
“surge” pricing. In contrast to income-target findings, we find that 
Uber partners drive more at times when earnings are high, and flexibly 
adjust to drive more at high surge times. A discontinuity design 
confirms that these effects are causal, and that surge pricing 
significantly increases the supply of rides on the Uber system. We 
discuss the implications of these findings for earnings, flexible work, 
and the efficiency of dynamically-priced labor markets.</div>

 of the recent research in differentiated product demand estimation is 
based on extensions of the logistic models pioneered by McFadden (1974).
  However, these models do not scale effectively to the very large data 
sets that have recently become available in applied marketing.  For 
example, we use daily data from Amazon’s US and EU e-book and physical 
book marketplaces.  This data has approximately 44 million titles 
available for purchase in the US and over 33 million titles in the EU. 
The data also has hundreds of thousands of hedonic attributes that could
 be used as regressors.  We propose methods to analyze demand more 
accurately at this larger scale by combining methods from econometrics 
and Machine Learning.  Unlike most work in Machine Learning, we 
construct estimators that have a clear economic interpretation and that 
are identified under standard conditions used in the evaluation 
literature.  As an application, we quantify some aspects of consumer 
behavior and price setting.  In particular, we estimate the compensating
 variation to consumers attributable to the increased selection 
available from Amazon’s online retail catalog.  We find that increased 
selection conservatively generates $2.2 billion in increased 
compensating variation in the US and $2.1 billion in the EU.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14028_abstract">Heightened
 polarization and political instability in the early twenty-first 
century has created growing concerns about policy uncertainty. Some 
economists argue that investment is likely to be reduced because of 
uncertainty about who will be making policy decisions, what policy 
decisions will be made by those who end up in charge, and how those 
policies will affect profits for firms. Although policy uncertainty is 
often presented as a recent issue, it is not new. In the past, 
government policies could be just as controversial as today, and when 
political power changed or crises emerged the future of those policies 
became less clear too. In this paper, I examine how policy uncertainty 
affected the investment of the English East India Company, which 
operated from 1600 to around 1850. A long-run, historical perspective is
 useful because the past offers multiple political and fiscal events to 
analyze the impacts of policy uncertainty. History also allows one to 
gauge the significance of policy uncertainty across time and in 
different contexts. The English East India Company was arguably the most
 important company in the world during its heyday around 1800. It 
maintained a monopoly over all trade between Britain and Asia for over 
200 years. By the early nineteenth century it accounted for 
approximately 50% of all European ships sailing to Asia. The English 
Company also controlled important regions in India, like Bengal, and 
laid the foundation for British colonial rule.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14029_abstract">In
 this paper, we address how inter-annual water supply volatility impacts
 certain agricultural outcomes over a long-time span. Climate 
change-induced warming patterns manifest in many ways in the western 
U.S., which include earlier snowmelt-driven streamflows (Cayan et al. 
2001; Stewart et al. 2005; Regonda et al. 2005), reduced late-season 
flow, and increased early-season flow (Stewart et al. 2005). A large 
reduction in mountain snow pack and a substantial shift in streamflow 
seasonality accompany these warming patterns, to the extent that by 
2050, the spring streamflow maximum is expected to arrive one month 
earlier in the year (Barnett et al. 2005). Since climate change reflects
 a long-term trend and adaptation and mitigation efforts take effect 
slowly, investigating the impacts of climate change and water supply 
over a long time span provides more insight than using data from 
short-term weather phenomena.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14031_abstract">This
 paper reopens the debate on international liquidity and adjustment 
under the Bretton Woods system. Despite numerous studies on the demand 
for foreign reserves conducted during the 1960s and early 1970s, we 
still know very little on the determinants of reserve accumulation 
during the Bretton Woods system. Papers published at that time used 
short time span and small samples and they relied on spurious 
econometrics. Studies on this topic stopped quickly after the end of the
 system and remained inconclusive (Williamson 1973). Despite several 
improvements in econometric techniques, availability of data and new 
developments in the theoretical and empirical literature on reserves 
(Obstfeld et al. 2010), there has been no attempt to reinvestigate the 
demand for foreign reserves under the Bretton Woods period. The 
literature on the correlation between business cycles across countries 
under Bretton Woods suffers from similar limitations. No study on this 
topic has been conducted since the 1970s whereas econometrics and data 
availability have greatly improved. In this paper, we build a new 
comprehensive quarterly database for the core countries of the Bretton 
Woods system (G10) and we challenge several misconceptions and widely 
held views about the functioning and outcomes of Bretton Woods. Our 
analysis of the accumulation of foreign reserves reveals fundamental 
flaws of the system and shows that confidence and adjustment problems 
were too severe to solve global imbalances problems. As a consequence, 
countries were strongly affected by international real and nominal 
shocks despite the use of capital controls. The Bretton Woods system 
does not appear as a Golden Age where countries could manage domestic 
policy without being constrained by international shocks and 
adjustments.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13869_abstract">The
 Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed a number of policies which affect 
hospital finances. Most notably, it expanded insurance coverage, which 
shifted the uninsured into high- (exchange plans) and 
moderate-reimbursement (Medicaid) plans. Insurance expansion also 
increases visits to hospital emergency departments via moral hazard. 
Concurrent with these pecuniary improvements, the ACA cut the 
Disproportionate Share Payments (DSH) which serve as lump-sum transfers 
to hospitals seeing many uninsured and publicly-insured patients. The 
net effect of these changes on hospital revenue in states that expanded 
Medicaid is expected to be positive; in states that did not, the net 
effect is currently unknown. 
We use a national census of hospital financial reports from 2006-2013, 
obtained via the HCRIS, Hospital Compare, and IME systems and 
systematically validated with local news reports and phone surveys, to 
evaluate the effect of the ACA on hospital finances. We model trends in 
expansion vs. non-expansion states on the secular trend in hospital 
closures via a difference-in-differences regression. Preliminary results
 suggest that the trend in closures slowed, but was no different between
 Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. We also analyze the impact
 of these closures on market concentration, average firm size, and payer
 mix. We then determine the distribution of changes in driving distance 
to the nearest hospital emergency department. We run sensitivity 
analyses to assess the impact of potential endogeneity of policy by 
matching states by the propensity to expand, and by using a synthetic 
control group methodology.</div>

 study measured the effect of the Affordable Care Act Insurance Coverage
 Expansion on Hospital Costs. This is a retrospective longitudinal study
 of hospital cohorts in selected states submitting 2011-2014 data to the
 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). States were classified 
according to implementation of the ACA Medicaid expansion.  
Difference-in-differences regression models were used to estimate the 
effect of the ACA insurance coverage expansion on hospital inpatient and
 emergency department costs and volumes. The contrast between expansion 
and non-expansion states was used to identify the effect of Medicaid 
expansion on volume and cost, while geographic variation in hospital 
market uninsurance rates was used to identify health insurance 
marketplace effects. The population studied was adults age 19-64 in 
selected states, with expected source of payment of Medicaid, private 
insurance or uninsured. A preliminary analysis of HCUP State Inpatient 
Databases showed that the largest and most consistent effects were 
discharge volume and payer mix transfers from the uninsured to Medicaid 
payment sources. Total discharge volume expansion effects were 
insignificant.  Expansion effects on hospital inpatient costs were 
insignificant, except for the uninsured, where expansion effects were 
negative.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13909_abstract">Abstract:
 In this paper, we estimate the demand for credit card services when 
lenders separately set the price of credit (interest rate) and the price
 of late payment (late fee). Preliminary estimates suggest that 
consumers' borrowing decisions are somewhat sensitive to interest rates,
 and insensitive to the late fee. Nevertheless, consumers' propensity to
 pay late is not entirely insensitive to the late fee. We then use these
 estimates to analyze the optimal pricing decision of a firm selling two
 products, focusing on how specific shocks to the price (or cost) of one
 good affects the overall pricing strategy of the firm. We apply our 
model to study the equilibrium effects of fee-cap regulation imposed by 
the 2009 CARD act, paying attention to both the supply and demand 
response and calculating overall effects on profits and consumer
surplus.</div>

 develop a model of banking industry dynamics to study the quantitative

accumulate securities like Treasury bills and undertake short-term 
borrowing when there are cash flow shortfalls. A nontrivial size 
distribution of banks arises out of endogenous entry and exit, as well 
as banks’ buffer stocks of securities. We test the model using business 
cycle properties and the bank lending channel across banks of different 
sizes studied by Kashyap and Stein (2000). We find that a rise in 
capital requirements from 4% to 6% leads to a substantial reduction in 
exit rates of small banks and a more concentrated industry. Aggregate

 We use data on mutual fund holdings to estimate a demand system for US 
debt instruments of various maturities. Our model allows us to evaluate 
counterfactuals like how would the demand for 3-month treasury bill 
change if the supply of 5-year bonds were to double. We also provide 
validation of our results of demand estimation from the mutual fund 
holdings by estimating this demand system directly using data from 
actual auctions of US government instruments. Using the actual bids 
submitted in the uniform price auctions and an equilibrium model of 
bidding we can recover the willingness-to-pay (and hence the demand 
curve) for each debt instrument directly. Using time variation in the 
supplied quantity of various instruments, we can also recover the 
substitution patterns. Finally, we use the model to evaluate the effects
 of Quantitative Easing of various counterfactual intensities.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13912_abstract">In
 this paper, we empirically investigate the extent to which information 
frictions, or search costs, might lead consumers to take out a pricier 
loan than they otherwise could have in the mortgage market. To that 
goal, we estimate an equilibrium model of costly search, where firms set
 prices in anticipation of limited search by consumers. On the creditor 
side, we combine data on rate sheets (e.g., prices) with market shares 
of individual creditors, separately for each state. On the consumer 
side, we use data on search intensities, creditor (non-price) 
preferences, and a host of other characteristics from a nationally 
representative survey. This data combination identifies the key object 
of interest: distribution of search costs in the population. Preliminary
 results indicate that the median search cost is in the order of 
1,000-1,500 dollars per one additional creditor visited (depending on 
the segment) and, importantly, the elimination of search costs would 
bring a 10-15% improvement in the consumer surplus, through better 
information and lower prices, after accounting for equilibrium responses
 of firms.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14118_abstract">Gender
 inequality remaining a serious issue around the world, new approaches 
to resolving it are needed; there is a large body of evidence that it is
 women who do most of the domestic work. Gender inequality in the labor 
market is ascertained by reference to seven gender gaps: labor force 
participation, human capital, the unpaid domestic and care work burden, 
vulnerable employment, wage employment, decent work, and social 
protection. The lower LFPR (Labor Force Participation Rate) of women 
compared to that of men represents an underutilization of women’s labor 
in the paid labor market which arises from inferior employment and 
decent work opportunities, human capital differences, and unpaid 
domestic labor and care constraints. When women participate in the 
formal paid economy, they suffer from several disadvantages, such as, 
carrying the extra burden of domestic responsibilities, poor human 
capital for the formal labour market, inferior status and poor prospects
 of getting good jobs in the core sector as well as poor upward mobility
 due to the burden of domestic responsibilities as a result, women may 
suffer from “time poverty. 
In this paper we attempt to shed light to give visibility to unpaid work
 in formal statistics, to understand the linkages between paid and 
unpaid work, and to integrate the monetary value of unpaid work in 
System of National Accounts in such a way that gender equity and LFPR is
 not sacrificed, for this purpose the supportive evidences would be 
taken from a detailed time-use survey of India.</div>

 occupational segregation measures quantify how uneven the distribution 
of a demographic group across occupations is with respect to that of 
other groups.  But when one is concerned with the consequences of 
segregation, one should also identify the “quality” of the occupations 
that the group tends to fill or, on the contrary, not to fill. This 
paper aims at quantifying the welfare losses that a society experiences 
due to the well-being losses that disadvantaged groups have for being 
concentrated in low-paid (or low status) occupations, an issue that, as 
far as we know, has not been formally dealt with in the literature. 
Apart from developing measures, this paper explores the evolution of the
 welfare loss of US society along the last decades derived from 
segregation by both gender and race. Segregation in this multigroup 
context implies accounting not only for disparities between women and 
men of the same race but also for differences between women of a given 
race and men of a different race and for differences within the same 
gender group across races. By quantifying the losses of society derived 
from the occupational sorting of the disadvantaged gender-race groups, 
this paper moves beyond the mere measurement of unevenness to focus on 
the economic consequences of that unevenness, which is where the main 
problem lies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12332_abstract">Prior
 research demonstrates that mortality rates increase during economic 
booms and decrease during economic busts, but little analysis has been 
conducted investigating the role of environmental risks as a potential 
mechanism for this relationship.  We investigate the contribution of air
 pollution to the procyclicality of deaths by combining county-level 
data on overall, cause-specific, and age-specific mortality rates with 
county-level measures of ambient concentrations of three types of 
pollutants and the unemployment rate. After controlling for demographic 
variables and state-by-year fixed-effects, we find a significant 
positive correlation between carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations and 
mortality rates.  Controlling for CO, particulate matter (PM10), and 
ozone (O3) attenuates the relationship between overall mortality and the
 unemployment rate by a statistically significant (at the 0.1 level or 
better) 17 percent. The findings are robust to the use of state rather 
than county level data and to a variety of alternative specifications. 
Our results are also consistent with those of other studies in the 
economics and public health literatures measuring the mortality effects 
of air pollution and suggest that changes in environmental risks are 
likely to explain some portion of the observed procyclical fluctuation 
in mortality.</div>

 study uses individual-level longitudinal data from Iceland, a country 
that experienced a severe economic crisis in 2008 and substantial 
recovery by 2012, to investigate the extent to which the effects of a 
recession on health behaviors are lingering or short-lived and to 
explore trajectories in health behaviors from pre-crisis boom, to 
crisis, to recovery. Health-compromising behaviors (smoking, heavy 
drinking, sugared soft drinks, sweets, fast food, and tanning) declined 
during the crisis, and all but sweets continued to decline during the 
recovery. Health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruit, fish oil, 
and vitamin/minerals and getting recommended sleep) followed more 
idiosyncratic paths. Overall, most behaviors reverted back to their 
pre-crisis levels or trends during the recovery, and these short-term 
deviations in trajectories were probably too short-lived in this 
recession to have major impacts on health or mortality. A notable 
exception is for alcohol consumption, which declined dramatically during
 the crisis years, continued to fall (at a slower rate) during the 
recovery, and did not revert back to the pre-crisis upward trend during 
our observation period. These lingering effects, which directionally run
 counter to the pre-crisis upward trend, suggest that alcohol is a 
potential pathway by which recessions improve health and/or reduce 
mortality.</div>

 this paper, we study the effects of shocks to local economic conditions
 on children’s health. While an extensive literature documents that 
increased unemployment rates are, perhaps counter-intuitively, 
associated with reductions in mortality and improvements in adult 
health, we know very little about how children’s health responds to 
changes in labor market conditions. The direction this relationship is 
difficult to sign a priori. On one hand, economic theory suggests that 
reductions in family income that accompany negative employment shocks 
will have negative effects on children’s health. On the other hand, 
unemployment may cause parents to substitute parental care for 
market-based childcare, potentially improving the quality of care and 
reducing children’s exposure to infectious diseases. Other potential 
mechanisms include changes in health insurance, parental mental health, 
and pollution exposure. 
We use restricted data from the National Health Interview Survey to 
provide some of the first estimates of the relationship between 
aggregate economic conditions and children’s health. Following previous 
literature, we begin by estimating the effects of local unemployment 
rates on children’s health. Next, we construct a predicted employment 
growth rate to isolate the effects of demand-induced changes in labor 
market opportunities. This instrument addresses potential endogeneity 
issues arising because unemployment rates capture changes in labor 
supply as well as labor demand. Finally, because previous literature 
suggests that the effects of changes in mothers’ and fathers’ employment
 opportunities may be different, we extend the shift-share approach so 
that we can separately estimate the effects of changes in labor demand 
for men and women on children’s health. 
We find that increases in state unemployment rates are associated with 
minor increases in injuries and emotional difficulties among children, 
but have no effects on parent-reported general health, activity 
limitations, sick days, ear infections, or asthma. Results using 
gender-specific labor demand indices suggest that these weak overall 
effects are masking opposite-signed effects of shocks to male and female
 labor demand. In particular, we find evidence that improvements in male
 labor market conditions are associated with better child health, while 
improvements in female labor market conditions are associated with worse
 parent-reported health and increases in asthma and emotional 
difficulties.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12335_abstract">According
 to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA, 2014),
 a pedestrian is hit and injured in traffic crashes every seven minutes 
and killed every two hours.  In 2012, pedestrian deaths increased 6 
percent from 2011 and accounted for 14 percent of all traffic fatalities
 (NHTSA, 2014).  About one-fifth of the pedestrians killed in traffic 
crashes in 2012 were involved in hit-and-run collisions.  MacLeod et al.
 (2012) report that, between 1998 and 2007, while the total annual 
number of pedestrian fatalities in the US declined, the proportion of 
hit-and-run pedestrian fatalities increased. Previous research has 
identified several individual and environmental factors that are 
associated with hit-and-run collisions.  Hit-and-runs are more prevalent
 in urban areas, at nighttime and early morning, under poor lighting 
conditions, during weekends, and on high-speed roads.  Drivers involved 
in hit-and-runs are more likely to be young (under the age of 25), male,
 intoxicated, and to drive without a valid license and a stolen vehicle.
  In unison, alcohol-impairment of pedestrians is also a crucial factor 
in pedestrian fatalities.  To the best of our knowledge, however, prior 
studies have not systematically investigated the longitudinal effects of
 alcohol and traffic policies on hit-and-run fatalities. In this paper, 
we use state-specific annual data are from the 1990-2012 Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System (FARS).  Given that the largest group of 
hit-and-run victims is pedestrians (accounting for about 60 percent of 
all hit-and-run fatalities), most of the analysis focuses on this group.
 Our empirical analysis controls for various other factors including 
macroeconomic conditions, proportion of young drivers, urban miles 
traveled, gas prices, and alcohol consumption. The results suggest that 
the .08 BAC limit may have an unintended consequence of increasing 
hit-and-run fatalities. We suspect that some drivers who are under the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14470_abstract">In
 the mid-1980s firms started adapting new inventory management concepts 
such as just-in-time production (JIT). The relevance of JIT for the 
simultaneous decline in macroeconomic volatility is the subject of an 
unresolved debate. This paper reexamines the effect of JIT at the firm 
level and its aggregate implications. Both feedstock and product 
inventory in German manufacturing have declined by only 25% since the 
1980s. The modesty of this reduction supports that the direct effect of 
JIT via inventory investment cannot explain the large drop in aggregate 
volatility. This paper proposes that the change in inventory risk 
exposure constitutes an important indirect effect of JIT. Inventory risk
 affects other spending and investment decisions of firms, and amplifies
 their response to uncertainty shocks. In a large firm panel, business 
expectations of firms with shorter inventory coverage respond 
significantly less to changes in the macroeconomic situation. This makes
 the sequence of decisions of firms with smaller inventory less erratic,
 and points towards a substantial contribution of inventory management 
to aggregate volatility.</div>

 from financial crises are characterized by low investment rates and 
declines in capital stocks. This paper constructs an equilibrium 
framework in which financial shocks have a persistent effect on 
aggregate investment. The key assumption is that physical capital is 
traded in a decentralized market with search frictions, generating 
``capital unemployment.'' After a negative financial shock, the share of
 unemployed capital is high, and the economy dedicates more resources to
 absorbing existing unemployed capital into production, and less to 
accumulating new capital. An estimation of the model for the U.S. 
economy using Bayesian techniques shows that the model can generate the 
investment persistence and half of the output persistence observed in 
the Great Recession. Investment search frictions also lead to a 
different interpretation of the sources of business-cycle fluctuations, 
with a larger role for financial shocks, which account for 33% of output
 fluctuations. Extending the model to allow for heterogeneity in match 
productivity, the framework also provides a mechanism for procyclical 
capital reallocation, as observed in the data.</div>

 supply decisions consist of both an extensive margin (new housing 
starts) and an intensive margin (construction intensity of incomplete 
houses). While it is well known that housing starts have declined 
dramatically during the 2006–2009 housing bust, the intensive margin of 
residential investment has not been studied in the literature. In this 
paper, we document that construction intensity of incomplete houses has 
also fallen significantly during the bust. Using the Census micro data 
for construction lags of single-family houses across the US, we show 
that average construction lags for completed houses increased during the
 bust, and that this increase comes from long deferrals of several 
houses under construction, especially those that were unsold at the 
early stage of construction. Motivated by these new facts, we study a 
time-to-build model of residential construction where investment in each
 stage is irreversible. The model predicts that as the level of 
uncertainty increases, the “wait-and-see” channel becomes relatively 
more important for the intensive margin than for housing starts. 
Calibrated to match the house price dynamics during the recent 
recession, the model accounts for the majority of the observed increase 
in construction lags, which suggests that the real-options mechanism 
played an important role in the dynamics of residential investment 
during the recent bust. Several housing supply implications based on the
 model follow.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14143_abstract">With the progress of globalization, the economy has rapidly shifted to service industries in Japan, while overseas transfer
of Japanese manufacturers has been developed. With these changes, the social systems and laws which regulated the
way of working of workers were diminished. For example, repeal of the Act on the Adjustment of Business Activities of
Retail Business at Large-scale Retail Stores promoted abolition of the regulation of business hours, or amending the
Worker Dispatching Law enlarged the numbers of dispatched workers. In the service industries in particular, the supermarkets
in Japan abolished the regular closing day, and the business hours came to be longer in distribution industries
and care giving for which demands have increased rapidly in an aging society since the nursing-care insurance system
was established.
And so, this presentation concerns the actual situation of employment, working conditions and employment structure, and
the mechanism of how these are decided at the workplaces in the service industries, especially in super-markets and care
giving, in which many female irregular workers are working. Moreover, we discuss how trade unions intervene in the
determination of business hours of the stores and establishment and working hours of workers and regulate them in these
industries. Additionally, we have to consider how trade unions have responded to reduction of the union density and
weakening of the influence of them in Japan.</div>

competition and cost reduction pressures have brought lower conditions 
of the female irregular workers in the service
industries on the other. Given that the industrial structural change is 
moving toward to service economy, this situation
could lead to the stratification and poverty problem in the coming 
society.
In this presentation, the working conditions of the female irregular 
workers in the service industries would be investigated
through two case studies in the supermarket and care giving. Firstly, 
their working hours, wages and social/company-level
security would be observed, and their relation to the precariousness and
 poverty would be discussed. Then, the effects of
the regulations and institutions like laws, agreements, company systems,
 or the influences of movements and negotiations would be analyzed as 
the determinants of the workplace conditions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14145_abstract">With
 the progress of globalization since the 1990s, the domestic economy has
 rapidly shifted to service industries in&lt;br /&gt;
Korea. The Korean service industries have two types of service 
industries. Both chaebol-owned and foreign companies,&lt;br /&gt;
which expelled the traditional, indigenous and small service industries,
 developed one type, and the other has been&lt;br /&gt;
involved in the service economy leaving the labor process and modes of 
work of the service workers as they traditionally&lt;br /&gt;
used to be.&lt;br /&gt;
An example of the former is the distribution industry. Since the 1990s, 
large-scale retail companies, owned by chabols or&lt;br /&gt;
established by a tie-up of chaebols and huge foreign retailers, such as 
large volume sales and super-markets have rapidly&lt;br /&gt;
dominated the retail market, which had been previously dominated by the 
traditional, indigenous, small wholesale and&lt;br /&gt;
retail businesses. The rapid growth of these large scales of retail 
companies has been dependent on the support of lowwage&lt;br /&gt;
female irregular workers, the only workers who could work flexibly 
responding to work fluctuation. We focus on how&lt;br /&gt;
the employment structure of large volume sales and super-market has 
changed since the irregular worker protection law&lt;br /&gt;
was established in 2007, and discuss how the female irregular workers in
 these workplaces have been organized, and&lt;br /&gt;
how their movement has developed since then.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, care giving has come to take a part of the mainstream
 of service industries in an aging society since&lt;br /&gt;
the nursing-care insurance system started in 2008. However, traditional,
 inferior employment and labor process of caregivers&lt;br /&gt;
have remained the same while they came to be employed as workers. And 
so, we clarify how care-givers have&lt;br /&gt;
been organized and how their movement has changed laws and systems in 
order to improve their working conditions and&lt;br /&gt;
acquire recognition of being workers, as well as the actual situation of
 these workers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14244_abstract">The
 United States has prohibited the sale of marijuana for decades, despite
 significant and widespread use among a fairly diverse section of its 
population. Since the turn of the century, a modest but growing number 
of states have adopted laws allowing for the legal sale of medical 
marijuana, and at least four have effectively legalized limited trade in
 modest amounts for recreational use. The potential size of the market 
for legal cannabis products is a question for which strong evidence is 
available for the first time in 75 years. Policymakers, taxpayers, as 
well as potential consumers and distributors of such products all have 
an interest in understanding the likely scale of this market, the 
regulatory structures that could reduce the dangers it poses, and the 
potential sources of conflict and tax revenue. Using a set of methods 
used in forensic economics, public policy studies, industrial economics 
and mathematical economics, and data from the first two years of legal 
operation in multiple states, we provide a new analysis on this 
important topic.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14246_abstract">In
 personal injury and wrongful death court cases, there are various 
methods for estimating economic damages. One way of ranking these 
methods is to see how they fare in an historical simulation, with 
methods ranked “better” if they match more closely an ex post earnings 
stream. The “best” method is then a structured settlement that pays out 
actual earnings in each future loss year. The present work points out 
two potential problems with this ranking. First, while a lump sum award 
based on present value is a loser in this ranking, it is nevertheless 
welfare improving, being preferred to the “winner” by the (risk averse) 
plaintiff and leaving the (risk neutral) defendant indifferent. Second, 
the logic of choosing a lump sum that does well in historical simulation
 is akin to that of an economist advocating for a structured settlement 
rather than a lump sum. For these reasons, the simulation approach 
should be treated with caution in forensic economic practice.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14563_abstract">This
 paper examines the problems of rural-urban migration and the widespread
 rate of urban unemployment in Sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries. As 
many SSA countries experience economic growth, structural transformation
 from the agricultural to manuafacturing sectors exposes the economy to 
exessive unemployment and surplus of labor. Investment in human capital 
as an engine for growth is expected to provide  a smooth transition, 
however, the urban sector has failed to absorb these skilled labor.We 
utilize the Solow Neo-classical growth model and data from the World 
Bank to estimate the rural-urban migiration and reverse migration for 
SSA countries facing servere unemployment among skilled labor in urban 
sectors. Our parameter estimates can potentially reveal that 
agricultural industrialization can absorb the surplus labor with postive
 value-added effect on agriculture. This suggests that institutional 
policies in these countries with excess unemployment must emphasize on  
agricultural sustainablility as an important component of achieving 
economic growth that is effective in reducing poverty.</div>

We combine data from coordination games, a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT), and a survey to assess whether others' intentions to sell to 
one's farmer group (cooperative) impacts one's actual sales to the 
farmer group during commercialization.  So, we seek to "solve" a 
group-based coordination dilemma that manifests itself as a failure to 
commercialize through one's farmer group. The study is conducted in 
conjunction with members of a sample of peanut-producing groups in 
Senegal.  

We find that intentions to coordinate/sell together impact actual 
coordination (collective commercialization).  In particular, farmers who
 are members of larger groups sell more through the group in the 
presence of others' intentions.  In addition, smaller farmers seem to 
benefit most from selling through the group.  Finally, there is 
suggestive evidence that farmers who were pre-exposed to the 
coordination games are more responsive to intentions revealed in the 
RCT. 

We are currently verifying robustness of these findings and exploring 
potential mechanisms.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14566_abstract">This
 paper explores Lewis' use of the terms of trade to explain likelihood 
of economic development convergence across countries to investigate, in 
turn, the possibilities for economic development convergence within a 
country with respect to distinct classes and racial communities. 
Following the economic logic which informed Lewis' prediction of 
economic convergence and divergence between countries, this study 
predicts that economic disparity (income inequality) between classes and
 races within a country will be explained by both the level of per 
capita income and by the strategic terms of trade prevailing during the 
process of a country's development process.  Lewis's insights on 
economic development convergence and divergence are theoretically 
incorporated within the S-Curve framework (Tribble, 1996, 1999).  This 
framework or model is utilized to identify phases in the structural 
process of development consistent with terms of trade impact on the 
likelihood of economic convergence or divergence across class and race 
category.  This study uses OLS estimation to empirically identify both 
the structural and terms of trade impacts on economic disparity between 
classes and races and within classes and races.  These empirical 
parameters are then utilized to assess the likelihood of development 
convergence across classes and races.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14567_abstract">International
 personal remittances are increasingly becoming an important source of 
household income and foreign exchange in developing countries. Although 
on a relative decline, official development assistance continues to be a
 major source of external finance, especially in Africa where in the 
aggregate it outweighs personal remittances as a share of GDP. While the
 effects of these two types of transfers on economic growth in 
developing countries have been a subject of numerous empirical studies, 
there is a paucity of comparative analyses of their implications for 
human development, especially in the context of Africa. This study seeks
 to assess the relative contributions of the said inflows to human 
development outcomes in the continent. To this end, an eclectic model of
 human development is specified and estimated using alternative panel 
data econometric methods. The results of the study are expected to shed 
light on the nature and strength of the link between the two financial 
inflows on the one hand and human development on the other, from which 
implications can be drawn about aid effectiveness and the socioeconomic 
effects of international migration on the source countries.</div>

 agent operating in a self-referential environment thinks the parameters
 of his model might be time-varying. In response, he estimates two 
models, one with time-varying parameters, and another with constant 
parameters. Forecasts are then based on a Bayesian Model Averaging 
strategy, which mixes forecasts from the two models. In reality, 
structural parameters are constant, but the (unknown) true model 
features expectational feedback, which the agent’s reduced form models 
neglect. This feedback allows the agent's fears of parameter instability
 to be self-confirming. Within the context of a standard linear present 
value asset pricing model, we use the tools of large deviations theory 
to show that the agent's self-confirming beliefs about parameter 
instability exhibit Markov-switching dynamics between periods of 
tranquility and periods of instability. However, as feedback increases, 
the duration of the unstable state increases, and instability becomes 
the norm. Even though the constant parameter model would converge to the
 (constant parameter) Rational Expectations Equilibrium if considered in
 isolation, the mere presence of an unstable alternative drives it out 
of consideration.</div>

mobility of children observed from 1850 to 1880 was greater than the 
mobility of children observed in the 1970s. These analyses, however, 
cannot speak to changes in mobility over the course of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries or across more than two generations. &lt;br 
/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to data limitations, analyses of mobility are often limited to two 
generations. Attempts to examine more than two generations have been 
limited to small samples, non-U.S. data, and analyses using indirect 
observations of intergenerational links (such as comparisons of income 
averages by surname over time). To overcome these problems, we link 
individuals across U.S. census data to examine changes in 
intergenerational and multigenerational mobility in the U.S. from 1850 
to the present. Our analysis examines both occupational and income 
mobility.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14444_abstract">We
 document the tendency of fathers in the U.S. to share employers with 
their sons and daughters. We show that the rate of job sharing is much 
higher than can be explained by the fact that fathers and sons tend to 
live near each other. Younger children are much more likely to share 
their father's employer, as are children of high-earning fathers. We 
find that sons’ earnings at shared jobs tend to be higher than at 
unshared jobs. We also find that this relationship is stronger for sons’
 of high-earning fathers: the increase in earnings at shared jobs is 
higher than the increase in earnings for children of low-earning 
fathers.  The increase in earnings stems largely from fathers helping 
sons find jobs in industries where they otherwise would be less likely 
to be employed and less from higher pay relative to other workers at the
 same employer.  We find that a job in manufacturing, construction, and 
wholesale trade is more likely to be a shared employer than a job in 
retail trade or food and accommodations.  However, once we control for 
employer characteristics, we find that a son who shares an employer with
 his father earns only slightly more than another man his age in the 
same industry.  For daughters, sharing an employer is only related to 
earnings if the father is in the top quartile of the earnings 
distribution and this is completely explained by firm characteristics.  
Finally, we find that shared employment strengthens the correlation 
between fathers’ and sons’ earnings ranks, contributing to lower 
intergenerational mobility.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14446_abstract">Subsidized
 housing development in low-income neighborhoods has the potential to 
improve housing options for low-income populations, but research is 
divided on whether subsidized housing opens up new neighborhoods to 
low-income individuals or simply reinforces neighborhood segregation by 
encouraging poor households to move to relatively poor areas.  This 
study addresses these questions by examining the Low Income Housing Tax 
Credit (LIHTC).  LIHTC is a very important component of the current 
subsidized housing stock, as it is responsible for providing funding to 
roughly one third of new multifamily construction built in the US over 
the past thirty years.    

Our study is unique in that it uses a large nationally representative 
panel data set derived from the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses of the 
US population.  We construct this data set using probabilistic matching 
techniques to link the 2000 long form of the decennial census to the 
2010 decennial census.  The size of this data set allows us to construct
 a variety of measures of neighborhood quality and examine the effects 
of low-income housing on neighborhood mobility across a diverse range of
 geographic areas. 

We use this data to examine whether an increase in low-income housing 
units due to LIHTC generates increased movement of low-income 
individuals into poorer neighborhoods.  Our analysis follows previous 
work such as Baum-Snow and Marion (2009) and Freedman and McGavock 
(2015) in exploiting discontinuities in eligibility rules that designate
 whether a census tract is a “Qualified Census Tract” (QCT) that 
receives additional subsidies for low-income housing development.   
While a large literature has examined the effect of subsidized housing 
on poverty concentration, we are the first to examine the origins of 
individuals moving into low-income housing on such a large scale.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14401_abstract">An
 important theme amongst heterodox economists for the past twenty-five 
years has been the idea that in order to advance Keynes’s idea of a 
monetary theory of production, or MTP (Graziani 2003, Fontana, Pacella 
and Realfonzo 2015), it is necessary to go beyond the arguments of the 
General Theory (1936) and to analyze in full the workings of the 
monetary circuit (Graziani 1990, Parguez and Seccarreccia 2000). In some
 writings before the General Theory (1936), Keynes (1933a, 1933b) did 
allude to the original Marxian monetary circuit, which he (Keynes) wrote
 as M – C – M’. However, these references did not survive in the 
published version. Nor did Keynes seem particularly confident about this
 concept in debates about interest rate theory in the Economic Journal 
and elsewhere the following year (Graziani 1984). It is therefore 
important to inquire exactly how the Marxian circuit was supposed to 
work. A starting point is to write out the scheme from Das Kapital, 
vol.2, ch.1 (Marx 1884), in full, that is, M – C ... P ... C’ –M’, and 
try to explain precisely what M’ – M, and C’ – C, are supposed to 
represent. This poses a further question, that economic sociologists 
have sometimes asked, but economists almost never, namely “where do 
profits come from” (Collins 1986)? It seems that the system must first 
generate positive aggregate profits in money terms before any “real” 
profit or surplus can come into existence for the parties to dispute.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14402_abstract">Andre
 Gunder Frank’s influential book Re-Orient was part of a revisionist 
development in the literature which suggested that the development of 
the West, with respect to the Rest, in particular with respect to the 
more developed areas of Asia, was relatively recent, and that it was 
essentially possible as a result of the resources associated with the 
colonization of the Americas by Western Europe. It is argued in this 
paper that Gunder Frank’s arguments are weakened by a Metallist 
conception of money, which presumes the functioning of the Quantity 
Theory of Money, and a conception of the world economy, which extends 
the World Systems literature on the formation of world markets 
considerably further into the past, naturalizing the existence of 
markets, and suggesting that there is no distinctive features to the 
capitalist mode of production, a category Gunder Frank denies any 
validity. We argue that a Cartalist or Chartalist perspective on money, 
which is complemented by an understanding the rise of capitalism, and 
the so-called Military-Fiscal State in Western Europe is essential to 
understand the Great Divergence.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14403_abstract">A
 far too widely held view among Post-Keynesian, Marxian and 
Institutionalist economists is that Sraffian analysis is fundamentally 
incapable of taking proper account of money. Some Post-Keynesians have 
criticized the Sraffian approach for failing to acknowledge the 
centrality of money and finance in market economies. This view is 
grounded in a narrow understanding of the Sraffian framework, and in 
particular, in a misunderstanding of its methodological underpinnings. 
Economists use different tools to address different problems. The 
analytical problems Sraffa addressed in Production of Commodities by 
Means of Commodities have nothing directly to do with money, hence money
 plays no role in the model developed in that book. This doesn’t mean 
that the model of 1960 implies the neutrality of money (as Davidson, 
Minsky and many other Post-Keynesians seem to think); nor does it mean 
that the insights we derive from his 1960 analysis are incompatible with
 monetary analysis. But what we say about money ought to be grounded in 
what we think about the mechanisms that determine relative prices and 
income distribution. There is in fact a significant body of literature 
in the Sraffian line that deals with monetary issues, particularly 
inflation, in a way that is generally compatible with Post-Keynesian 
views on money. Sraffa’s earliest economic writings were on monetary 
economics, and one of the reasons that Keynes was so deeply impressed 
with the young Sraffa is that the latter’s perceptive baccalaureate 
thesis on the asymmetric effects of inflation and deflation had a lot in
 common with Keynes’s Tract on Monetary Reform. This paper will argue 
that while there are many issues about which Post-Keynesians and 
Sraffians may legitimately and fruitfully disagree, their differences on
 monetary questions have been grossly exaggerated.</div>

to endogenous money within post-Keynesian economics: the evolutionary 
and the revolutionary views.  The first approach defines endogenous 
money in terms of specific institutions and conclude that money became 
endogenous over time as these institutions developed.  Such an approach 
is defended by Chick (1986) and Niggle (1991), in particular.  In 
contrast, a revolutionary approach to endogenous money suggests that 
money is always endogenous irrespective of the historical period of 
specific institutional settings.  This is because money is debt, created

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14405_abstract">Shadow
 banking is increasingly acknowledged as a normal feature of megabank 
activity, even while its scope and extent remain only partially 
understood. At the same time, the growth of shadow banking activity is 
acknowledged as a source of extraordinary financial risk, as evidenced 
by the recent initiatives of the European Central Bank, the Bank for 
International Settlements, and the Financial Stability Board to identify
 lists of large complex financial institutions for which extra capital 
margins will be required. 
The definition of shadow banking as “normal banking activities conducted
 outside the protections offered by national bank regulators” does not 
go to the heart of what this phenomenon means for the understanding of 
contemporary finance. Shadow banking consists of financial activities 
undertaken in such a way as to avoid regulation. These activities’ 
inclusion within the boundaries of ‘normal banking activities’, which 
themselves are increasingly dominated by too-big-to-fail megabanks, is 
transforming the nature of credit and money markets – and thus, given 
the endogenous-money framework, the very meaning of money itself.
This paper explores the nature, scope, and size of shadow banking, and 
the implications of this phenomenon for the meaning – the economic and 
social roles – of money. We map the geographic spread and volume of 
shadow banking more completely than has been done to date, including the
 spatial exposures to risk and social vulnerabilities that arise from 
the spread of shadow banking. Of particular importance is the widely 
differing capacity of different countries to provide "lender of last 
resort" protection for their financial systems. The paper takes further 
the analysis of Chiong, Dymski, Hernandez (2015) regarding the growing 
dominance of international banking conventions and rules relative to the
 authority of national law. The paper concludes by examining the 
economic and and social implications of this transformation of the 
meaning of money.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14462_abstract">The
 racial wealth gap is a stark and pervasive piece of the American 
landscape. Unlike the frequently cited disparities in educational 
attainment, occupational status, and household income, the racial wealth
 gap looms wider as it has resisted any mitigation over the past 50 
years. Despite this record, the primary economic model on wealth 
accumulation – the Life Cycle Hypothesis – has nothing to say on the 
subject. In this paper, I offer an alternative model, what I call the 
Wealth Privilege model. This model simply examines the primary pathways 
that households accumulate wealth: household saving, asset appreciation,
 and family gifts and inheritances. For those with means, each pathway 
operates as a virtuous cycle enabling families to build wealth with 
increasing ease. For those with little wealth, they experience the same 
pathways as vicious cycles that limit their capacity to accumulate 
wealth. These disparate experiences give rise to the growing 
concentration of wealth.</div>

show that instead of progressively eroding discrimination, labor markets
 may reproduce racial and ethnic disadvantages for some groups and

 Great Recession exacerbated pre-existing racial and ethnic wealth 
disparities. In 2009, the median wealth of whites was 20 times as high

 As a result of their low levels of savings and asset accumulation, 
Hispanics and African-Americans are often at a disadvantage relative to 
whites in terms of their readiness for retirement. Using data from the

 study the effects of labor mobility within a currency union suffering 
from nominal rigidities. When the demand shortfall in depressed region 
is mostly internal, migration may not help regional macroeconomic 
adjustment. When external demand is also at the root of the problem, 
migration out of depressed regions may produce a positive spillover for 
stayers. We consider a planning problem and compare its solution to the 
equilibrium. We find that the equilibrium is generally constrained 
inefficient, although the welfare losses may be small if the economy 
suffers mainly from internal demand imbalances.</div>

 evidence on the importance of cross-border equity flows calls for a 
rethinking of the standard theory of external adjustment. We introduce 
equity holdings and portfolio choice into an otherwise conventional 
open-economy dynamic equilibrium model. Our model is simple and it 
admits an exact closed-form solution regardless of whether financial 
markets are complete or incomplete. In this simple framework, we are 
able to establish interconnections between the real side of the economy,
 represented by the trade balance, the current account, and consumption 
allocations and the financial side, such as portfolio holdings, stock 
prices and valuation changes. Methodologically, we contribute to the 
existing DSGE literature on international portfolio choice  that so far 
has either relied on approximation methods or used simplified asset 
market structures.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13355_abstract">How
 do international shocks affect domestic prices? In this paper, we 
estimate the effect of exchange rate changes on the prices that firms 
charge in their domestic market. These prices can be affected directly 
through the marginal cost channel for firms that import their 
intermediate inputs and indirectly through the markup channel as firms 
respond to changes in their competitors’ prices. The contribution of 
this paper is to examine, theoretically and empirically, the impact of 
exchange rate shocks on domestic prices, isolating the role of both the 
marginal cost and the markup channels, while taking explicit account 
that all prices in the economy are set simultaneously. We find that 
strategic complementarities play an important role in transmitting 
international shocks into domestic prices. We show that about a half of 
exchange rate movements is transmitted into the average domestic prices,
 with the marginal cost and the markup channels playing nearly equal 
roles. Firm heterogeneity plays a central role in this transmission 
mechanism, with small firms reacting mostly through the marginal cost 
channel and large firms adjusting more through the markup channel. Large
 firms exhibit substantially stronger strategic complementarities than 
small firms. Lastly, we provide a calibrated model of variable markups 
able to match a number of salient features of our data, and then use it 
to undertake a number of counterfactuals.</div>

 construct a dataset containing daily prices for hundreds of goods that 
collectively represent the bulk of expenditures on fuel, food, and 
consumer electronics in seven countries since 2010. Relative to earlier 
work, including our own, we significantly increase the coverage of goods
 studied by measuring prices in common physical units such as grams, 
items, or liters. We can therefore reasonably compare across countries 
the prices of otherwise identical goods sold in slightly different 
package sizes. We use these data to ask how price levels and dynamics 
for the same good varies across countries, with a focus on uncovering 
the extent to which the exchange rate, measurement error, and price 
stickiness dictate the extent of law of one price variations. Finally, 
we consistently scrape the web pages of the 10 largest online retailers 
in each country and note the total number of available varieties within 
narrowly defined categories. This allows us to characterize the scale of
 cross-country differences in the availability of consistently defined 
consumer varieties.</div>

 construct housing price indices for 120 major cities in China in 
2003-2013 based on sequential sales of new homes within the same housing
 developments. By using these indices and detailed information on 
mortgage borrowers across these cities, we find that despite the 
enormous housing price appreciation during the decade, the price 
appreciation was accompanied by equally impressive growth in household 
purchasing power, except in the few first tier cities, and housing 
market participation by households from the low-income fraction of the 
city population remained steady. Nevertheless, the severe financial 
burdens endured by bottom-income mortgage borrowers throughout China, 
who commonly used price-to-income ratios over eight to buy homes, 
reflected expectations of persistent high income growth and housing 
price appreciation into the future. Such expectations can contract 
substantially in the event of a sudden stop in the Chinese economy and 
present an important source of risk to the housing markets.</div>

 claims about conditions in Chinese housing markets are challenging to 
evaluate because of data limitations.  We bring new data to bear on this
 issue and examine a wide array of property market risk metrics and 
fundamentals.  On average across 35 large cities, real land and house 
prices have grown at double-digit rates on a compound annual basis over 
the past decade.  However, there is substantial heterogeneity across 
markets, with Beijing’s land prices appreciating at a real 27.5% rate 
and its house prices growing by 20% per annum.  Interestingly, there is 
no evidence that supply growth has outpaced demand growth over the past 
decade in the nation’s capital.  This is in stark contrast to conditions
 in a dozen large, primarily interior markets in which substantial 
excess supply appears to exist.  All Chinese markets, including Beijing,
 are risky in the sense that appear to be ‘priced to perfection’.   Even
 a modest downward shift in expectations of future price growth could 
generate a sharp decline in asset values.  However, the biggest downside
 risks are in those places with burgeoning supply-demand imbalances, as 
any negative economic shock would hit an oversupplied market.  
Fundamentals do matter, as statistical analysis finds that a one 
standard deviation higher normalized inventory is associated with a 0.45
 standard deviation lower rate of real house price growth the following 
year.</div>

 paper provides a theory to explain the paradoxical features of the 
great housing boom in China---the persistently faster-than-GDP housing 
price growth, exceptionally high capital returns, and excessive vacancy 
rates. The expectation that high capital returns driven mainly by 
resource reallocation are not sustainable in the long run can induce 
investors, including even the very productive entrepreneurs to speculate
 in housing during economic transition. This creates a self-fulfilling 
growing housing bubble, which can create severe resource misallocation. A
 calibrated version of the theory accounts quantitatively for both the 
growth dynamics of house prices and other salient features of the recent
 Chinese experience.</div>

 test asset pricing theory using the Bazacle company of Toulouse, the

1946. We find a real average dividend yield of 5% per annum and no 
long-term price growth. An asset pricing model with persistent dividends
 and a time-varying risk correction is not rejected by the data. 
Variations in expected future dividends explain between one-sixth and 
one-third of variations in prices. Moreover, the risk correction is

volatility.</div>

 analyze aggregate market prices and dividends throughout modern

 we start with the Dutch and English markets in the early 17th century 
and move to the U.S. market at the end of the 19th century. We find that
 the dividend-to-price ratio predicts returns throughout all four 
centuries. “Excess volatility” is thus a pervasive feature of financial 
markets. The dividend-to-price ratio also predicts dividend growth rates
 in all but the most recent (post 1945) period. Cash-flows were 
therefore much more important for price movements in the past, and the 
dominance of discount rate news is a relatively recent phenomenon. This 
is consistent with the increased duration of the stock market in the 
recent period.</div>

 bubble episodes are rare events. In this paper, we examine what factors
 might cause some asset price bubbles to become very large. We recreate,
 in a laboratory setting, some of the specific institutional features 
investors in the South Sea Company faced in 1720. Several factors have 
been proposed as potentially contributing to one of the greatest periods
 of asset overvaluation in history: an intricate debt-for-equity swap, 
deferred payment for these shares, and the possibility of default on the
 deferred payments. We consider which aspect might have had the most 
impact in creating the South Sea bubble. The results of the experiment 
suggest that the company’s attempt to exchange its shares for government
 debt was the single biggest contributor to the stock price explosion, 
because of the manner in which the swap affected fundamental value. 
Issuing new shares with only partial payments required, in conjunction 
with the debt-equity swap, also had a significant effect on the size of 
the bubble. Limited contract enforcement, on the other hand, does not 
appear to have contributed significantly.</div>

 paper examines the long-run performance of an actual invested art 
portfolio, namely the collection of John Maynard Keynes. We estimate 
returns based on hand-collected purchase data and expert valuations. We 
find that, in the first years following Keynes’ purchases, his art 
portfolio strongly outperformed the equity market. Our results suggest 
that informed art investors can do well in the art market by identifying
 particularly attractive prices. After the late 1950s, the collection 
continued to appreciate in real terms, even if it did not do as well as 
equities. Our estimate of the Keynes collection’s performance over the 
last half century is similar to previous art market return estimates 
based on auction sales data. At the same time, however, the variation in
 returns across the constituents of Keynes’ portfolio helps to 
illustrate a number of potential issues with auctions-based price 
indexes: (i) the returns to purchases at auction can differ 
systematically from the returns to other types of acquisitions; (ii) 
because of the high concentration in the art market, an equally-weighted
 index may provide a biased view of art’s performance; (iii) the 
positive skewness in returns implies that the typical 
(under-diversified) art investor under-performs the market.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21965_abstract">We
 explore gender dynamics in referral-based hiring, using a field 
experiment at one of Europe's leading business schools. In the 
experiment, 428 students are asked to refer another student at the 
school for a part time job. We find strong evidence of same-gender bias 
in referrals among both male and female students. While the overall 
gender distribution of students at the school is fairly equal, 74 
percent of male students refer another man and 71 percent of female 
students refer another woman. Roughly half of this same-gender bias can 
be accounted for by gender differences in social network composition at 
the school. These results are robust across different jobs with varying 
gender stereotypicality.</div>

 achieve gender balance, academia has still a long way to go. In Europe 
women account for 46% of PhD graduates, 37% of associate professors and 
only a mere 20% of full professors. The US displays similar patterns and
 in Japan the gender imbalance is even larger. This paper analyzes the 
role of the gender composition of promotion committees in shaping this 
gap. The gender of evaluators might matter for several reasons. First, 
male candidates might benefit from the existence of an “old-boys 
network". Second, if women tend to specialize in different subfields 
than men and evaluators overrate the importance of their own types of 
research, the lack of female evaluators might be detrimental for female 
candidates. Third, male evaluators might perhaps be subject to gender 
stereotypes. We exploit evidence from two large-scale randomized natural
 experiments: centralized scientific evaluations in Spain and in Italy. 
In these two countries applicants to Full or Associate Professor 
positions are required to qualify in an examination that is conducted at
 the national level by a committee of (randomly selected) experts. Our 
database includes information on around 100,000 applications and 8,000 
(randomly selected) evaluators. We proxy networks using information from
 co-authorships and theses committees. These networks tend to be 
slightly gendered and there is also some gender segregation across 
subfields. However, the chances of success of female candidates do not 
increase with the number of women in evaluation committees, if anything 
the opposite is true. Information from 274,000 individual evaluation 
reports also shows that, in mixed-gender committees, male and female 
evaluators are equally biased against female candidates, suggesting that
 the presence of women in the committee affects the voting behavior of 
male evaluators. These findings suggest that the introduction of gender 
quotas in scientific committees is unlikely to increase female 
representation.</div>

19,962 teaching evaluations, where students are randomly allocated to

nor self-study hours are affected by the teacher's gender, we find that 
in particular male students evaluate female teachers worse than male 
teachers. The bias is largest for junior teachers, which is worrying 
since their lower evaluations might affect junior women's confidence and
 hence have direct as well as indirect effects on women's progression

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11129_abstract">Gender
 differences in willingness to compete have recently emerged as a 
potential source of gender differences in academic career choices and 
labour market outcomes. I study how individual willingness to enter 
competitions evolves over time and ask the following questions. How does
 the gender gap in competitiveness change in response to wins and 
losses? How do early wins and losses shape willingness to compete and 
earnings in the long run? Participants in a lab experiment have to 
choose between piece-rate and winner-takes-all remuneration for their 
performance in a task over four rounds. In each round, they are 
allocated to a random opponent and learn whether they performed better 
or worse. While I find no initial gender difference in the willingness 
to compete, a significant gender gap emerges over time as men and women 
react differently to competition outcomes. Conditional on performance, 
an early loss leads to persistently lower willingness to compete over 
the following rounds. Beliefs about own relative ability do a poor job 
of explaining these dynamic changes.</div>

 study the interaction between inequality, credit market imperfections 
and rational asset bubbles. We show that income inequality and asset 
pledgeability play essential roles in influencing the existence and 
characteristics of asset price bubbles. If a bubble asset has low 
pledgeability, then the asset primarily provides a store of value to 
agents with a high demand for savings, and is thus held in equilibrium 
by the rich. On the other hand, if the bubble has high pledgeability, 
then it provides high collateral value to borrowing-constrained agents, 
and thus the bubble asset is held in equilibrium by the poor. The asset 
bubble gives rise to a credit bubble, in which borrowers take on 
excessive risk because of the possibility of default, and the collapse 
of the asset bubble leads to widespread default. Our findings therefore 
provide an explanation for prominent stylized features of the recent 
crisis in the U.S.: a boom in housing prices in 2002-2006, associated 
with a boom in borrowing against housing collateral and home equity 
among low-income households, and the widespread default among “subprime”
 borrowers following the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007-2009.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12422_abstract">A
 sovereign's willingness to repay its foreign debt depends on the cost 
of raising taxes. The allocation of this tax burden across households is
 a key factor in this decision. To study the interaction between the 
incentive to default and the distributional cost of taxes, I extend the 
canonical Eaton-Gersovitz-Arellano model to include heterogeneous 
agents, progressive taxation, and elastic labor supply. When the 
progressivity of the tax schedule is exogenous, progressivity and the 
incentive to default are inversely related. Less progressive taxes, and 
hence higher after-tax inequality, encourage default since the cost of 
raising tax revenue from a larger mass of low-income households 
outweighs the cost of default in the form of lost insurance 
opportunities. When tax progressivity is endogenous and chosen 
optimally, the government internalizes the influence of progressivity on
 default risk and the cost of borrowing. As such, committing to a more 
progressive tax system emerges as an effective policy tool to reduce 
sovereign credit spreads in highly indebted countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12423_abstract">This
 paper makes the case that a significant number of recent financial 
innovations were designed to extract rents from public safety nets or 
bailouts and resulted in a large redistribution of resources to the 
financial sector. We develop a model in which bailouts arise 
endogenously: when financial sector capital is low, it is cheaper for 
the rest of the economy to provide a bailout than to suffer from a large
 credit crunch. It is well known that such bailouts distort incentives 
to invest in risky securities. This paper shows that bailouts also 
provide incentives to create new securities that crystallize risk-taking
 on states of nature in which bailouts will be obtained. This allows for
 more efficient rent extraction on a significantly larger scale. The 
incentives for rent extraction are mediated through market prices and do
 not require that the agents who engage in risk-taking are aware that 
they are extracting rents from public safety nets. In aggregate, the 
described behavior leads to large financial sector profits during good 
times, higher consumption volatility, greater economy-wide risk premia 
and stark misallocations in real investment.</div>

 account regressions show that when top income shares are added to the 
comprehensive set of conventional explanatory variables used by the IMF,
 they predict significantly larger current account deficits in a 
cross-section of advanced economies, but with important outliers among 
countries that have pursued export-led rather than finance-led growth 
strategies. To study this mechanism, we develop a DSGE model where the 
income share of top earners increases at the expense of bottom earners. 
Due to preferences for wealth, top earners have a much higher marginal 
propensity to save than bottom earners, as they do in the data. We find 
that, when the redistributive shock has a large positive effect on asset
 values, and if domestic financial markets are large, the result will be
 a sizeable current account deficit. On the other hand, when the 
redistributive shock mostly affects relative labor incomes, and if 
domestic financial markets are small, the result will be a current 
account surplus.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12818_abstract">A
 more nuanced hypothesis on the nature of recent technological progress 
has emerged, which considers technological progress as a Routine-biased 
shock. The resulting literature studying the effects of recent 
technological progress has mostly focused on the within-industry changes
 in employment and wages. Yet economic progress, driven by such 
technological advances, takes place at an uneven rate across different 
sectors of the economy. This paper adds to an emerging literature 
considering how such uneven productivity changes at the sector level 
affect the relative price, wage and employment structures of our 
economies. In particular, it presents a unifying framework that accounts
 for the emergence of four key empirically documented phenomena: job 
polarization, a divergence of de-industrialization in terms of 
employment and real output, Baumol's cost disease, and the deceleration 
in the growth of the skill premium. These phenomena, however, are not 
natural laws, and the model allows examining the conditions under which 
they occur. The model's predictions are tested in a sample of 16 
advanced countries over 1970-2007.</div>

low- and high-wage workers. Given that polarization is a long-run 
phenomenon and closely linked to the shift from manufacturing to 
services, we propose a structural change driven explanation, where we 
explicitly model the sectoral choice of workers. Our simple model does 
remarkably well not only in matching the evolution of sectoral 
employment, but also of relative wages over the past fifty years.</div>

 ubiquitous discussions of robots’ potential impact, there is almost no 
systematic empirical evidence on their economic effects. In this paper 
we analyze for the first time the economic impact of industrial robots, 
using new data on a panel of industries in 17 countries from 1993-2007. 
We find that industrial robots increased both labor productivity and 
value added. Our panel identification is robust to numerous controls, 
and we find similar results instrumenting increased robot use with a 
measure of workers’ replaceability by robots, which is based on the 
tasks prevalent in industries before robots were widely employed. We 
calculate that the increased use of robots raised countries’ average 
growth rates by about 0.37 percentage points. We also find that robots 
increased both wages and total factor productivity. While robots had no 
significant effect on total hours worked, there is some evidence that 
they reduced the hours of both low-skilled and middle-skilled workers.</div>

 administrative employee-firm-level data from 1994 to 2007, we show that
 the labor market in France has become polarized: employment shares of 
high and low wage occupations have grown, while middle wage occupations 
have shrunk. During the same period, the share of hours worked in 
technology-related occupations ("techies") grew substantially, as did 
imports and exports, and we explore the causal links between these 
trends. Our paper is the first to analyze polarization in any country 
using firm-level data. Our data includes hours worked classified into 22
 occupations, as well as imports and exports, for every private sector 
firm. We show that polarization is pervasive: it has occurred within the
 nonmanufacturing and manufacturing sectors, and both within and between
 firms. Motivated by the fact that technology adoption is mediated by 
technically qualified managers and technicians, we use an innovative 
measure of the propensity to adopt new technology: the firm-level 
employment share of techies. Using the subsample of firms that are 
active over the whole period, we show that firms with more techies in 
2002 saw greater polarization from 2002 to 2007. Firm-level trade, by 
contrast, has a small effect on polarization. To control for the 
endogeneity of firm-level techies and trade in 2002, we use values of 
techies and trade from 1994 to 1998 as instruments. We also show that 
firms with more techies in 2002 grew more rapidly from 2002 to 2007, 
using the same instrumental variable strategy. We conclude that 
technological change, mediated through techies, is an important cause of
 polarization in France. Trade is less important.</div>

 goal of this paper is to examine the major tensions between the 
monopoly face of licensing and the potential consumer protection goals 
of occupational regulation in the health care industry. Historically, 
health care occupations have limited the supply of providers as a method
 of raising wages, but with growth in the number of newly regulated 
occupations, many professions have come in conflict with one another 
over who gets to do the work. Rather than having consumers decide, state
 legislatures and licensing boards determine the allocation of tasks. 
The paper outlines policies that may allow consumers rather than service
 providers to determine the allocation of these jobs.</div>

 a recent IMF survey and expanding on previous studies, we document the 
use of macroprudential policies for 119 countries over the 2000-13 
period, covering many instruments. Emerging economies use 
macroprudential policies most frequently, especially foreign exchange 
related ones, while advanced countries use borrower-based policies more.
 Usage is generally associated with lower growth in credit, notably in 
household credit. Effects are less in financially more developed and 
open economies, however, and usage comes with greater cross-border 
borrowing, suggesting some avoidance. And while macroprudential policies
 can help manage financial cycles, they work less well in busts.</div>

 does the CCB affect mortgage pricing after Switzerland was first to 
activate this macroprudential tool of Basel III? As we observe multiple 
offers per request, our findings relate to mortgage supply and demand. 
First, the CCB changes the composition of mortgage supply, as 
capital-constrained and mortgage-specialized banks raise prices more in 
relative terms. Second, risk-weighting schemes linked to borrower risk 
do not amplify the CCB effect. To conclude, changes in the supply

 analyze the impact of liquidity and reserve requirements on credit 
supply. For identification, we exploit a change in regulation in Uruguay
 – an increase of the requirements for short-term funding, especially 
from (retail and interbank market) foreign funds – using the credit 
register that follows all loans granted to non-financial firms. 
Following a difference-in-difference approach, we compare lending to the
 same firm before and after the policy change among banks with different
 exposure to the funds targeted by the policies. We find that 
restrictions to short-term deposits for banks imply a reduction of 
credit supply; more affected banks increase their exposure into riskier 
firms; and larger banks mitigate the effects. Our results suggest that 
foreign short-term capital inflows and liquidity requirements affect 
credit supply and risk-taking of banks.</div>

 use data on UK banks’ minimum capital requirements to study the 
interaction of monetary policy and capital requirement regulation. UK 
banks were subject to both time-varying capital requirements and changes
 in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or 
monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks 
reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary
 policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little 
evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The 
differences in the responses of small and large banks, and the lack of 
interaction between capital requirement changes and monetary policy, 
have important policy implications. Our results confirm the theoretical 
consensus view that monetary policy should focus on price stability 
objectives and that capital requirement changes are a more effective 
tool to achieve financial stability objectives related to loan supply. 
We also identify important distributional consequences within the 
financial system of these two policy instruments. Finally, our findings 
do not corroborate theoretical models that raise concerns about complex 
interactions between monetary policy and macroprudential variation in 
capital requirements.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12522_abstract">Several
 school districts use assignment systems in which students have a 
strategic incentive to misrepresent their preferences. Indeed, we find 
evidence suggesting that reported preferences in Cambridge, MA respond 
to these incentives. Such strategizing can complicate the analysis of 
preferences. The paper develops a new method for estimating preferences 
in such environments. Our approach views the report made by a student as
 a choice of a probability distribution over assignment to various 
schools. We introduce a large class of mechanisms for which consistent 
estimation is feasible. We then study identification of a latent utility
 preference model under the assumption that agents play a Bayesian Nash 
Equilibrium. Preferences are non-parametrically identified under either 
sufficient variation in choice environments or sufficient variation in a
 special regressor. We then propose a tractable estimation procedure for
 a parametric model based on Gibbs' sampling. Estimates from Cambridge 
suggest that while 84% of students are assigned to their stated first 
choice, only 75% are assigned to their true first choice. The difference
 occurs because students avoid ranking competitive schools in favor of 
less competitive schools. Although the Cambridge mechanism is 
manipulable, we estimate that welfare for the average student would be 
lower in the popular Deferred Acceptance mechanism.</div>

 We evaluate a simple allocation mechanism of students to majors at 
college entry that was commonly used in universities in Brazil in the 
1990s and 2000s. Students first chose a single major and then took exams
 that select them in or out of the chosen major. The literature 
analyzing student placement, points out that this decentralized 
mechanism is not stable and is not strategy-proof. This means that some 
pairs of major &amp; students can be made better off and that students 
tend to disguise their preferences using such a mechanism. We build up a
 model of performance and school choices in which expectations are 
carefully specified and we estimate it using cross-section data 
reporting choices between two medical schools and grade performances at 
the entry exams. Given those estimates, we evaluate changes in selection
 and students' expected utilities when other mechanisms are implemented.
 Results highlight the importance of strategic motives and 
redistributive effects of changes of the allocation mechanisms.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14498_abstract">In
 most of the developed world, skilled women marry at a lower rate than 
unskilled women. We document heterogeneity across countries in how the 
marriage market penalty for skilled women has evolved over time. As 
labor market opportunities for women have improved, the gap in 
ever-married rates between skilled and unskilled women has been 
decreasing in North America, Nordic countries, and some parts of Western
 Europe. In sharp contrast, the marriage gap has widened in East Asia 
and parts of Southern Europe, with singlehood rates for skilled women 
reaching unprecedented levels in the most recent cohorts. We propose a 
theoretical model in which the (negative) social attitudes towards 
working women might contribute towards the lower marriage rate of 
skilled women, and might also induce a non-linear relationship between 
their labor market prospects and their marriage outcomes. A marriage 
market penalty (or premium) emerges endogenously in our model as a 
function of skilled women’s rising labor market opportunities and the 
time allocation decisions that these generate. We show that the 
interaction between women’s labor market opportunities and gender norms 
generates a U-shaped marriage penalty. The model allows us to 
characterize the dynamics of the marriage market penalty for skilled 
women in an environment with specific gender norms as the labor market 
opportunities for them increase. The model is also valuable in 
generating comparative statics across environments with more or less 
conservative gender identity norms. We test the key assumptions and 
predictions of the model in a panel of 20+ developed countries as well 
as across states in the US.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14499_abstract">In
 many European countries the labor market is segmented into public and 
private sectors. The public sector is considered to be family friendly 
and allow for combing motherhood and career development.  In this paper,
 we take advantage of the Danish administrative records to explore how 
women adjust work conditions after giving birth to their first child by 
changing the employment sector and thus smooth earnings consequences of 
maternity. In particular, we show that switching from private to public 
sector is most frequent for high skilled professionals in occupations 
with low freedom to make decisions and with high time pressure. This 
specific brain-drain can explain why we observe high gender wage gaps in
 occupations with convex pay schemes.  Further, our estimates of the 
motherhood wage gap suggest that women who switch from private to public
 sector lose the least on their post-motherhood wage gap due to 
motherhood in each respective post-birth year, while women who stay in 
the private sector are building up the most on their pre-motherhood wage
 gap.</div>

 study whether earnings dependent parental benefits have a positive 
impact on fertility, and whether they are successful at narrowing the 
baby gap between high educated (high earning) and low educated (low 
earning) women. I exploit a reform in parental leave benefits in 
Germany: Up until 2007 German parental benefits were means-tested 
transfers and targeted at lower income families. From 2007 onwards 
parental leave benefits were increasing in mother’s pre-birth earnings 
with a minimum benefit being granted to all mothers. The reform 
increased the financial incentives to have a child for higher educated 
and higher-earning women considerably, by up to 21,000 €. First I find 
large discontinuous jumps in overall monthly birth rates nine months 
after the passing of the law as well as evidence for discrete drops in 
abortion rates for married women just after the law was passed. Second, I
 exploit the large differential changes in parental leave benefits 
across education and income groups to estimate the causal effect of 
parental leave benefits on fertility. I find a positive, statistically 
significant effect of an increase in benefits on fertility, which is 
mainly driven by women in the middle and upper-end of the education and 
income distribution. My findings suggest that earnings dependent 
parental benefits, which compensate women for their opportunity cost of 
childbearing accordingly, might be a successful means to increase the 
fertility rate of high-skilled and higher-earning women and to reduce 
the disparity in fertility rates with respect to mothers’ education and 
earnings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13588_abstract">Traditional
 finance theories state asset prices are determined by firm 
fundamentals, such as per-share earnings and relative risk. However, a 
growing body of literature shows prices often do not reflect underlying 
value and are largely formed by expectations of future cash flows that 
are discordant with financial fundamentals and are vulnerable to 
cross-sectional sentiment influences. This paper demonstrates asset 
mispricing by a biological driver of competitive bidding — testosterone —
 in experimental asset markets. We show that testosterone drives 
competitive bidding leading prices to dissociate from fundamental value,
 producing larger and longer-lasting bubbles. Further, testosterone

 investigate the consistency and stability of individual risk 
preferences by manipulating cognitive resources. Participants are 
randomly assigned to an experiment session at a preferred time of day 
relative to their diurnal preference (circadian matched) or at a non- 
preferred time (circadian mismatched) and choose allocations between two
 risky assets (using the Choi et al., 2007, design). Consistency of

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13591_abstract">The
 effect of stress on economic choice is well documented in the 
psychological and economic literature but less attention has been paid 
to 1) the generalizability of these effects to populations in the 
developing world; and 2) to what extent the effect of stress is 
influenced by the domain in which it resides.  To answer these 
questions, we conduct a series of random-assignment experiments among 
urban poor in Nairobi, Kenya.  We randomly assign participants to stress
 or non-stressed conditions, where stress is activated in a social, 
physical, or financial domain. In the social domain, we use the Trier 
Social Stress Test, in the physical we use the Cold Pressor Task, and to
 induce financial stress we design a real-time centipede game. 
Subsequently, we measure inter-temporal choice using a titration 
exercise with real monetary payoffs. We find that both the reactivity to
 the stressor as well as the effect on inter-temporal choice are domain 
dependent.</div>

 a novel laboratory experiment I find that hunger increases monetary 
impatience. This effect is larger when monetary rewards are immediate, 
which shows that present bias is a visceral response and can help 
explain why the poor tend to make more shortsighted economic decisions. 
Given possible confounds between physical and cognitive resource 
depletion, I also manipulated cognitive fatigue. I find that cognitive 
fatigue also increases monetary impatience; nevertheless this effect is 
driven by an increase in corner solutions. I argue that this may reflect
 a decrease in attention and an increase in heuristic-based choices.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11720_abstract">Developing
 and emerging economies typically achieve much lower tax/GDP ratios than
 industrialized countries. Some scholars argue that corruption is one of
 the major obstacles to achieve higher revenue levels. The phenomenon of
 corruption in relation to tax revenues so far was mostly considered in 
relation to macro-economic variables. Recent taxation reforms focused on
 the increase of the tax base in order to compensate for reduced 
revenues from trade tariffs.
Hence the public budgets increasingly rely on the compliance of 
smaller-scale tax payers.These people also are vulnerable to become 
victims of petty corruption if they need to make payments to corrupt 
public servants in order to get access to public services. These 
extortion experiences may prevent them from contributing to the public 
budget. This study explores how petty corruption affects tax morale in 
sub-Saharan Africa where the phenomenon is quite prevalent. Based on the
 data from Afrobarometer 5 this paper finds that individual corruption 
experiences as well as the perception of the government and the tax 
department in general have a sizable impact on tax morale.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11909_abstract">The
 rapid growth of Political Action Committees – expenditures neared $500 
million in the 2012 presidential election – is center-stage in the 
debate over money in American politics. The effect of PACs on elections 
depends on regulation and its interaction with imperfect competition. 
Congress requires stations to treat candidates to the same office 
equally, and to sell campaigns airtime at lowest unit rates (LURs) 
within sixty days of a general election. This paper examines pricing to 
PACs, which are not protected under the law, and the impact of political
 advertising regulation, in particular, lowest unit rate regulation. 
Using novel data on prices paid for individual ad spots from the 2012 
presidential election, I find that stations price discriminate 
substantially across PACs for indistinguishable purchases. On average, 
PACs pay 40% markups above regulated rates. Republican PACs pay 14% 
higher prices on average relative to their Democrat counterparts, but 
there is substantial idiosyncratic variation in prices paid across ad 
spots. I develop and estimate a model of political demand for ad spots, 
exploiting misalignments of state borders and media markets to address 
potential price endogeneity. Findings indicate that pricing to PACs 
reflects buyer willingness-to-pay for viewer demographics. Taken 
together, these results indicate the current regulatory regime 
differentially subsidizes candidates depending on the characteristics of
 their base.</div>

We consider a political competition model where voters use the incumbent’s
performance in mitigating the shock’s aftermath to update their beliefs
about his competence. A better performance leads to the incumbent’s
electoral advantage, and this allows him to announce a policy closer to his
bliss point. Hence, we show that exogenous shocks occurred during the
current term affect candidate platforms announced for the next term, and the
better the incumbent’s performance, the more extreme policy he will pursue.
Using the data on natural disasters and political platforms of legislators
across American states in 1953-2010 we confirm our predictions, and find
that exogenous shocks increase political polarization in case of the better
incumbent’s performance.</div>

 protests that have taken a violent form in the United States and 
elsewhere have renewed interest in the study of  such low-level 
political violence and its efficacy. However, estimating the effect of 
violent forms of political protest on protest success is complicated by 
endogeneity and omitted variable bias. In this work, I utilize 
instrumental variables methods to estimate a causal effect of violent 
protest on the likelihood that protesters win policy concessions. Using 
daily French protest data and a set of school holiday and weather 
instruments, I find a significant and negative relationship between 
property destruction associated with protests and the chance of 
near-term success in changing policy. The IV estimates are larger than 
OLS estimates and are robust to a variety of alternative specifications.
 Such findings are predicted by several posited endogeneity channels,

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10684_abstract">This
 paper studies a regime change model in which, when a rebel leader 
mobilizes civilians, he faces a trade-off between the increasing number 
of potential supporters and the risk of information leak. The authority 
may then decide to use one of two punitive approaches: 1) harsh 
collective punishment, in which both rebel participants and those 
associated with them are punished, or 2) lenient punishment, in which 
only the rebel participants are held accountable for their actions. I 
find that harsh punishment results in a smaller rebel group size 
compared to lenient punishment, which is subject to the free rider 
problem. Meanwhile, choosing harsh punishment comes at a price, by 
forcing many to side with the insurgency, which may decrease the 
authority’s survival chances. My findings also indicate that lenient 
punishment is more useful to prevent a revolution by ordinary citizens, 
while collective punishment should be adopted to prevent a coup staged 
by the politicians. Furthermore, when both authorities and rebel leaders
 compete for support by threatening retribution against the 
non-supporters, both parties tend to prefer the use of harsh methods to 
force civilians to choose sides.</div>

 governments regularly conduct inspections to assess and improve public

have a set number of inspections per entity per year. We examine the

In collaboration with Yelp and the City of Boston, we ran an open

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12846_abstract">Recent
 studies have examined racial disparities in stop-and-frisk, a widely 
employed but controversial policing tactic. The statistical evidence, 
though, has been limited and contradictory. We investigate by analyzing 
three million stops in New York City over five years, focusing on cases 
where officers suspected the stopped individual of criminal possession 
of a weapon (CPW). For each CPW stop, we estimate the ex-ante 
probability that the detained suspect would have a weapon. We find that 
in 44% of cases, the likelihood of finding a weapon was less than 1%, 
raising concerns that the legal requirement of reasonable suspicion was 
often not met. We further find that blacks and Hispanics were 
disproportionately stopped in these low hit rate contexts, a phenomenon 
largely attributable to lower thresholds for stopping individuals in 
high-crime, predominantly minority areas, particularly public housing. 
Even after adjusting for location effects, however, we find that stopped
 blacks and Hispanics were still less likely than similarly situated 
whites to possess weapons, indicative of racial bias in stop decisions. 
We demonstrate that by conducting only the 6% ex-ante highest hit rate 
stops, one can both recover the majority of weapons and mitigate racial 
disparities. Finally, we develop stop heuristics that can be implemented
 as a simple scoring rule, and have comparable accuracy to our full 
statistical models.</div>

 science literature has shown a strong connection between the visual 
appearance of a city’s neighborhoods and the behavior and health of its 
citizens. Yet, this research is limited by the lack of methods that can 
be used to quantify the appearance of streetscapes across cities or at 
high enough spatial resolutions. In this paper, we describe 
‘StreetScore’, a computer vision algorithm that predicts the perceived 
safety of a streetscape, using training data from an online survey with 
contributions from more than 7000 participants. Using StreetScore, we 
create high resolution maps of perceived safety for 21 cities in the  
Northeast and Midwest of the United States at a  resolution of 200 
images/square mile, scoring more than 1 million images from Google 
Streetview. Our interactive dataset can be found at 
http://streetscore.media.mit.edu. Using the same online survey, we also 
develop algorithms that can predict the perception of wealth, beauty and
 liveliness in cities. We demonstrate that algorithms to quantify urban

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12518_abstract">We
 build a micro-founded two-country dynamic general equilibrium model in 
which trade responds more to a cut in tariffs in the long run than in 
the short run. The model introduces a time element to the fixed-variable
 cost trade-off in a heterogeneous producer trade model. Thus, the 
dynamics of aggregate trade adjustment arise from producer-level 
decisions to invest in lowering their future variable export costs. The 
model is calibrated to match salient features of new exporter growth and
 provides a new estimate of the exporting technology. At the micro 
level, we find that new exporters commonly incur substantial losses in 
the first three years in the export market and that export profits are 
backloaded. At the macro level, the slow export expansion at the 
producer level leads to sluggishness in the aggregate response of 
exports to a change in tariffs, with a long-run trade elasticity that is
 2.9 times the short-run trade elasticity. We estimate the welfare gains
 from trade from a cut in tariffs, taking into account the transition 
period. While the intensity of trade expands slowly, consumption 
overshoots its new steady-state level, so the welfare gains are almost 
15 times larger than the long-run change in consumption. Models without 
this dynamic export decision underestimate the gains to lowering 
tariffs, particularly when constrained to also match the gradual 
expansion of aggregate trade flows.</div>

 paper combines two firm-level customs datasets for French and Chinese 
exporters to estimate the trade elasticity of exports with respect to 
tariffs at the firm-level. This elasticity reveals the consumer's 
response to a change in trade cost: a demand side parameter. We then 
show that, when dropping the assumption of Pareto-distributed 
heterogeneity, this parameter is important to explain the aggregate 
reaction of bilateral exports to trade cost shocks. Furthermore, in this
 No-Pareto case, the trade elasticity is not constant, and varies across
 country pairs. Using our estimated demand-side parameter and a key 
supply-side parameter measuring the degree of dispersion of firms' 
productivity, we construct the predicted bilateral elasticities under 
the assumption of log-normally distributed productivity. The prediction 
on the aggregate elasticities, and its decomposition into different 
margins fits well with our aggregate estimates using French and Chinese 
data, suggesting that both demand and supply-side determinants matter in
 the reaction of trade patterns to trade costs variations, and that 
micro-data is a key element in the estimation of the macro-level 
elasticity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12521_abstract">Can
 a country gain international competitiveness by the design of optimal 
monetary stabilization rules? This paper reconsiders this question by 
specifying an open-economy monetary model encompassing a ‘production 
relocation externality,’ developed in trade theory to analyze the 
benefits from promoting entry of domestic firms in the manufacturing 
sector. In a macroeconomic context, this externality provides an 
incentive for monetary authorities to trade-off output gap with 
pro-competitive profit stabilization. While helping manufacturing firms 
to set competitively low prices, optimal pro-competitive stabilization 
nonetheless results in stronger terms of trade, due to the change in the
 country’s specialization and composition of exports. The welfare gains 
from international policy coordination are large relative to the case of
 self-oriented, strategic conduct of stabilization policy. Empirical 
evidence confirms that the effects of monetary policy design on the 
composition of trade predicted by the theory are present in data and are
 quantitatively important.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13737_abstract">Entering
 the labor market in recessions can have persistent effects on young 
workers' earnings. However, the channels through which this effect 
occurs are not well understood. Existing research points to job mobility
 as an important contributor to young workers' earnings growth. Several 
recent studies document that recessions are associated with a decline in
 aggregate job creation by high-quality firms. Hence, changes in the 
composition of jobs and resulting reductions in the pace and quality of 
job changes could be an important channel in explaining the lasting 
earnings effect from an unlucky start into the labor market. This paper 
evaluates the effect of entering the labor market in recessions and the 
underlying mechanisms using a matched longitudinal employer-employee 
data set from the U.S. Social Security Administration ranging from 1980 
to 2012. The paper begins by updating information on the role of job 
mobility in young workers' careers from a seminal paper in this 
literature based on data from the 1950s-1970s. It then assesses the role
 of firm quality in early career growth. Finally, it analyzes to what 
extent changes in mobility patterns can explain lasting effects on 
earnings from entering the labor market in a recession either at the 
state or national level.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13518_abstract">Young
 workers are exposed to higher risk of unemployment than prime age 
workers in large part because the job separation rate declines with age.
 Employment protection legislation may amplify this problem. When 
dismissal costs increase with tenure, young people are more likely to be
 laid off than the prime age workers. This phenomenon is especially true
 on segmented labor markets, where the high dismissal costs of permanent
 jobs increase the instability of temporary jobs. We provide and 
estimate a search and matching model that reproduces the negative 
relation between job separation and tenure. The model is estimated for 
the labor market of unskilled workers in France over the period 
2003-2012. We use a discontinuity in the relation between tenure and 
dismissal costs to identify the red-tape costs of employment protection 
legislation. In France, the employers have to pay at least six months' 
salary to the employees in case of unfair dismissal on a permanent job 
if the tenure is beyond two years. Before this threshold, no minimum 
amount is required. This implies that employees have strong incentives 
to go to court in case of contract termination only when the tenure is 
beyond two years. Accordingly, red-tape dismissal costs increase 
significantly at the two-year threshold. We show that this hike in 
red-tape costs translates into a strong increase in the job separation 
rate before the two-year threshold and a huge drop just after this 
threshold. Our model allows us to identify, together with the drop in 
the job separation rate after the two-year threshold, the red-tape 
layoff costs. Once the layoff costs are identified, we run 
counterfactual analysis to evaluate their impact on labor market flows 
and on youth unemployment. We find that job protection has a significant
 impact on youth unemployment. This impact is bigger in downturns than 
in upturns.</div>

 investigate the welfare effects of economic recessions across 
generations depending on the dualism of labor markets and social safety 
nets. In two-tier labor markets of Southern Europe and Scandinavia 
unemployment increases are borne entirely by younger generations, 
whereas the age gradient of labor market adjustment is modest in the 
United States and Anglo Saxon countries, and it is flat in Germany and 
Continental Europe. In Southern Europe, limited unemployment insurance 
for workers under fixed term contracts exacerbates the negative impact 
of dualism on the welfare of younger generations, whereas national 
safety nets cushioned such effects in Scandinavian countries. To assess 
the consequences of dualism in labor market arrangements and safety nets
 for the welfare of different generations we perform a stress test of 
European welfare states during the Great Recession. We find that 
material deprivation increased more for younger generations in Southern 
Europe and for older generations in the United Kingdom, whereas it 
remained constant in Continental Europe and Scandinavia.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10294_abstract">This
 paper investigates the impact of the early adaption of high-technology 
machines on long run economic growth. In particular we study the effect 
of population growth after the introduction of mechanical clocks during 
the late Middle Ages in European cities. Mechanical clocks were 
introduced in Europe for the first time at the end of the thirteen 
century and spread all over Europe during the following two centuries. 
Mechanical clocks belong to the most important general purpose 
technologies of the last millennium: defined as the prototypical 
computers by Landes (1983), mechanical clocks were the main drivers of 
improvement in production process and in coordination of market 
transactions.

To test the impact of clocks on economic growth (approximated by urban 
population growth), we construct a unique data-set collected from 
several historical sources and exempted by selection bias, where we 
identify the date of the adoption of the mechanical clock for all cities
 which have at least 5,000 inhabitants in Europe between the late 13th 
and the end of the 15th century. We study the causal relationship 
between this technology and the economic performance based on city 
population growth controlling for a set of institutional and 
geographical variables.
In our study we deal with the endogeneity problems very carefully. We 
use the distance from the first adapters and the geographical areas 
affected by different of appearance of solar eclipses as an instrument 
for the implementation of clocks. Historians have convincingly shown 
that the creation of so-called astrolabes, which were the predecessors 
(and technological basis) of the mechanical clocks were triggered by 
solar eclipses. We use these insights and use the geographical data 
provided by NASA of solar eclipses from 800 until the end of the 13th 
century.</div>

 investigate how individual workers and local labour markets adjust over
 a long time period to a discrete and plausibly exogenous technological 
shock, namely the introduction of containerisation in the UK port 
industry. This technology, which was introduced rapidly between the 
mid-1960s and the late-1970s, had dramatic consequences for specific 
occupations within the port industry. Using longitudinal micro-census 
data we follow dock-workers over a 40 year period and examine the 
long-run consequences of containerisation for patterns of employment, 
migration and mortality. Preliminary results show that the job 
guarantees in place up until 1989 successfully protected dock-workers’ 
employment up until 1991. More surprisingly, using a matched comparison 
of workers in comparable unskilled occupations reveals that, even after 
job guarantees were removed, dock-workers did not fare worse than the 
comparison group in terms of their labour market outcomes. Our results 
suggest that job guarantees may significantly reduce the cost to workers
 of sudden technological change, albeit at a significant cost to the 
industry.</div>

 estimate the effect of government spending at the county level using a 
previously little studied spending program, the Vinson-Trammell Act of 
1934. This act aimed to build up the United States Navy to treaty 
allowances, and this effort was stimulated by fears about Japanese 
military expansion. From historical and contemporary sources, I identify
 local areas in the United States that hosted active shipyards in 1934, 
which I use to estimate the local effects of government spending in a 
time of considerable economic slack. I find that manufacturing output, 
value added, employment, and earnings all rise faster over the course of
 the 1930s in counties hosting shipyards at the time of the bill’s 
passage. Also, I see significantly faster growth in county level retail 
sales, supporting the use of a model that allows for complementarity 
between labor and consumption. These effects do not persist past World 
War II, and a study of separate ship spending during the course of the 
war does not reveal such positive effects. This suggests that the 
effects of government spending are dependent on economic conditions. 
Interpreting my results in the context of the model of Nakamura and 
Steinsson (2014), I can roughly translate them to an aggregate 
government spending multiplier that may be as high as 7 to 9 when the 
monetary authority pursues a constant nominal interest rate policy.</div>

 Post-Reagan military personnel contractions in the United States 
between 1988 and 2000 shrank the size of the U.S. military by 30 
percent, hundreds of local economies hosting military bases were 
affected. As military personnel pull out of a locale, demands for local 
labor, housing, and locally-traded goods decline. This paper jointly 
estimates the impacts of this personnel reduction on the short-run 
dynamic and long-run equilibrium quantities and prices of local labor 
markets, local housing markets, and local product markets, and calculate
 welfare impacts on variables local economic stakeholders. Empirically, 
this paper shows that the widely used shift-share instrument, which uses
 the product between local historical levels and contemporaneous macro 
changes to instrument for local changes, can be invalid and thus lead to
 inconsistent estimates. This is because local historical levels can be 
driven by some unobservable local characteristics that affect the 
outcome variable via other channels. In order to establish causal 
identification, this paper proposes and estimates a two-step empirical 
model combining synthetic control and instrumental variables methods. I 
find that Military personnel contractions have sizable effects on 
civilian employment levels and the numbers of private businesses. But 
this employment reduction translates into out-migration of local 
civilian residents to other jurisdictions, resulting in a drop in rental
 prices that is larger than the drop in wages. This paper then builds a 
simple spatial equilibrium model that describes the equilibrium 
conditions and derives expressions for welfare calculation. Relating 
them to the econometric estimates, it is shown that the welfare cost on 
workers is small while that on landowners is sizable. Finally, a dynamic
 analysis shows that local economies achieve new equilibria within two 
to three years after the shock.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13022_abstract">The
 emergence of peer-to-peer rental markets allow owners of durable goods 
to rent out their excess capacity to non-owners. When the rental market 
emerges, both owners and non-owners economize on their usage until the 
market clears. Rental rates are increasing in consumer valuations, as a 
higher valuation increases demand or reduces supply among non-owners and
 owners, respectively. If the pre-rental market excess capacity of 
owners exceeds the capacity demanded by non-owners, a glut is possible. 
In the long-run, all consumers can revise their ownership decisions and 
when this occurs, the rental rate equals the product market purchase 
price and ownership does not depend on consumer valuation. The fraction 
of consumers owning in the long-run is the population average usage 
rate. If the market-clearing short-run rental rate is above the purchase
 price, ownership will increase in the long-run. In the long-run and 
short-run rental markets, the unlocked social surplus is increasing in 
the valuation of former non-owners and decreasing in the valuation of 
owners, though both groups see welfare increase in both the long- and 
short-runs. In the long-run P2P rental market a higher product market 
price is supportable, as owners can partially offset the purchase price 
through rental income. Because long-run rental rates equal the purchase 
price and consumers derive consumption value from the good even without 
rental, firms are not competitive in the long-run rental market.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21975_abstract">Online
 marketplaces have reduced entry costs across a variety of industries. 
These marketplaces allow small and part-time service providers (peers) 
to participate in economic exchange, often in competition with more 
traditional suppliers. For example, Airbnb and Uber allow almost anyone 
to become a hotelier or a cab driver. We first characterize market 
conditions favoring the entry of peer producers. In the context of the 
accommodation industry, we verify that across US major cities larger 
Airbnb presence is associated with low opportunity costs of renting out 
spare rooms, high investment costs of building hotels, and high demand 
volatility. We then provide reduced form evidence on the effect of 
Airbnb entry on hotels revenue, and highlight important city 
heterogeneity. We then derive a simple model of competition between a 
peer-to-peer marketplace and hotels to explain our reduced form 
findings. Lastly, we discuss preliminary work in estimating this model. 
This model allows us to determine the efficient market structure 
conditional on the level and variability of demand, and to quantify the 
welfare gains from peer-to-peer entry in the accommodation industry.</div>

 study a central economic problem for peer-to-peer online marketplaces: 
how to create successful matches when demand and supply are highly 
variable. To do this, we develop a parsimonious model of a frictional 
matching market for services, which lets us derive the elasticity of 
labor demand and supply, the split of surplus between buyers and 
sellers, and the efficiency with which requests and offers for services 
are successfully matched. We estimate the model using data from 
TaskRabbit, a rapidly expanding platform for domestic tasks, and report 
three main findings. First, supply is highly elastic: in periods when 
demand doubles, sellers work almost twice as hard, prices hardly 
increase and the the probability of requested tasks being matched only 
slightly falls. Second, we estimate average gains from each trade to be 
$37. Because of the matching frictions and search costs needed to find 
potential matches, the ex-ante gains are more modest, but are maximized 
by the elastic labor supply: if the number of hours worked were held 
constant, there would be 15 percent fewer matches in equilibrium. Third,
 we find that platform success varies greatly across cities. The cities 
which grow fast in the number of users are also those where the market 
fundamentals promote efficient matching of buyers and sellers. This 
heterogeneity in matching efficiency is not attributable to scale 
economies, but is instead related to two measures of market thickness: 
geographic density (buyers and sellers living close together), and level
 of task standardization (buyers requesting homogeneous tasks).</div>

 develop a new dynamic model of peer-to-peer Internet-enabled rental 
markets for durable goods in which consumers may also trade their 
durable assets in (traditional) secondary markets, transaction costs and
 depreciation rates may vary with usage intensity, and consumers are 
heterogeneous in their price sensitivity and asset utilization rates. We
 characterize the stationary equilibrium of the model. We analyze the 
welfare and distributional effects of introducing these rental markets 
by calibrating our model with US automobile industry data and 2 years of
 transaction-level data we have obtained from Getaround, a large 
peer-to-peer car rental marketplace. Our counterfactual analyses vary 
marketplace access levels and matching frictions, showing that 
peer-to-peer rental markets change the allocation of goods 
significantly, substituting rental for ownership and lowering used-good 
prices while increasing consumer surplus. Consumption shifts are 
significantly more pronounced for below-median income users, who also 
provide a majority of rental supply. Our results also suggest that these
 below-median income consumers will enjoy a disproportionate fraction of
 eventual welfare gains from this kind of 'sharing economy' through 
broader inclusion, higher quality rental-based consumption, and new 
ownership facilitated by rental supply revenues.</div>

 2008 crisis and economic downturn triggered the largest worldwide trade
 contraction since WWII. Standard models are unable to fully account for
 either the depth of this "great trade collapse" or its relatively fast 
reversal. The crisis also generated widespread fear of a global trade 
war. We examine if the resulting change in policy uncertainty initially 
deepened the collapse and then helped reverse it, when the worst fears 
of protection were not realized. To do so, we provide the first anatomy 
of the dynamics of U.S. exports at the firm level before, during and 
after the collapse. Among other things we find that about 40% of the 
drop in U.S. export value during the collapse is due to a net exit of 
firms from trading. We then develop a dynamic model with sunk costs of 
entry into foreign markets where heterogeneous firms face demand 
uncertainty arising from foreign policy and economic conditions. We 
construct measures of demand uncertainty that vary over time, countries 
and industries to estimate their impact on U.S. firms' export entry and

The effect of these changes depends crucially on the ability of factors to move in response. Therefore
a key object of interest is the elasticity of local employment  to these changes in the economic
environment, which depends on commuting and migration. We develop a quantitative general
equilibrium model that incorporates spatial linkages between locations in goods markets (trade)
and factor markets (commuting and migration). We find substantial heterogeneity across locations
in local employment elasticities depending on their characteristics. We show that this heterogeneity
is important for the effects of a variety of policies and exogenous shocks. We show that treating

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12561_abstract">Management
 practices and participation in international trade vary substantially 
across firms and countries. We provide the first evidence on the links 
between managerial competence, export performance and import activity 
using detailed data on the management practices, balance sheets and 
customs transactions of 485 Chinese firms in 1999-2008 and over 10,000 
US firms in 2010. Better managed firms are more likely to export, sell 
more products to more markets, and have higher export sales. Management 
plays a distinct role from TFP and is disproportionately more important 
for exporting than for overall output. Better managed Chinese firms 
charge higher export prices within narrow destination-product markets, 
but do not sell higher quantities. By contrast, better managed US firms 
sell higher quantities within narrow destination-product markets, but do
 not charge higher prices. Better managed firms in both China and the US
 use more imported inputs and import more expensive inputs from more and
 richer countries of origins. These results suggest that superior 
managerial practices enhance firms’ trade performance by allowing them 
to more efficiently produce more complex goods of higher quality, but 
that US and Chinese firms operate at different segments of the quality 
distribution. Inferior managerial practices may thus be an important 
obstacle for developing nations that depend on trade for economic 
growth.</div>

 fund flow to local bodies responsible for implementing social programs 
is based on intended expenditure ratified by higher levels of 
administration. This paper reports on a field experiment which evaluated
 an e-governance reform of the fund-flow system for the workfare program
 in the Indian state of Bihar. The reform changed the traditional fund 
flow practice by instead conditioning fund disbursement for wage 
payments on incurred expenditure as reflected in worker detail entry on a
 new electronic platform. This reform reduced the number of 
administrative tiers associated with wage disbursement and changed the 
informational requirements for requesting and disbursing program funds. 
We find that fund transfers to local bodies declined by 38%, program 
expenditure and reported employment declined by 25%, but with no 
discernible impact on actual employment as measured by independent 
surveys. Our results suggest that e-governance can improve public funds

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13206_abstract">Public
 sector organizations often base policy decisions on reports from 
interested parties that are costly to verify. If accurate, this 
information can then serve the dual purpose of incentivizing performance
 and reducing policy mistakes. Received wisdom suggests that the benefit
 of raising performance via financial incentives should be balanced 
against the risk of collusion resulting in false reporting. We evaluate 
two different forms of monitoring using mobile technology by 
head-teachers of Ugandan primary schools, randomly varying whether 
reports of teacher attendance trigger financial incentive payments or 
not. A theoretical model provides a normative framework to make welfare 
comparisons, taking in account teacher attendance, cost of monitoring, 
and also policy mistakes due to false reporting. Consistent with the 
model, we find that teacher attendance, monitoring frequency, and the 
number of false reports all increased with the introduction of financial
 incentives. More surprisingly, but again consistent with the theory, we
 find that the number of policy mistakes actually decreased: there were 
more false reports but this effect was counter-balanced by more reports 
in general and (hence) fewer mistakes due to a lack of information. 
Taken together, we conclude that welfare was higher with financial 
incentives. This paper makes a more general methodological contribution 
by highlighting the benefit of closely incorporating theory in 
experimental work.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13208_abstract">How
 do public employment programs affect the markets in which the poor live
 and work? Progress on this question has been slow, as non-experimental 
estimates based on program rollout are often sensitive to methodology 
and unable to capture the effects of mature, steady-state 
implementation. In this paper we exploit an unusual opportunity to 
estimate general equilibrium effects experimentally, using large-scale 
randomized assignment of an improvement to the implementation of India's
 public employment scheme. We find that this intervention raised 
private-sector wages (5.4%) and household earnings (13%) substantially. 
The vast majority (88%) of the earnings increase came from private 
sector as opposed to program earnings, underscoring the importance of 
measuring general equilibrium impacts. Interestingly, we do not find 
evidence of corresponding labor market distortions, with private sector 
labor supply weakly increasing and overall agricultural activity, as 
proxied by vegetation, increasing significantly.  We discuss both 
practical policy implications and connections to older debates over 
equity, efficiency, and political economy in the process of development.</div>

 debtor-friendly bankruptcy regime limits the amount of assets creditors
 can seize from distressed individuals. In response, creditors may 
redistribute credit towards richer and more able individuals. We show 
that increasing the amount of asset protection in bankruptcy 
(exemptions) leads to higher income inequality in the state. Using 
geographic variation in banking market structure and variation in 
capital needs across industries, we show that the increase in income 
inequality is mediated by a credit market channel. We analyze different 
population groups and find that the increase in inequality is driven by a
 growing income gap between unskilled and skilled individuals that 
affects both self-employed and wage workers. We also find a drop in the 
employment rate and in the relative wage of unskilled workers.
Our results indicate that the redistribution of credit leads to an 
imbalance in economic opportunities among entrepreneurs that reduces the

 use of M&amp;A in bankruptcy has increased dramatically, leading to 
concerns that Chapter 11 leads to excessive liquidation of viable firms.
 In this paper, we argue that the rise of M&amp;A has blurred 
traditional distinctions between “reorganization” and “liquidation”. We 
examine the drivers of M&amp;A activity, based on factors specific to 
Chapter 11 as well as more general factors that drive M&amp;A waves for 
non-distressed firms. M&amp;A in bankruptcy is counter-cyclical, and is 
more likely when the costs of financing a reorganization are greater 
than financing costs to a potential acquirer. Consistent with a senior 
creditor liquidation bias, the greater use of secured debt leads to more
 sales in bankruptcy – but, this result holds only for sales that 
preserve going concern value. We also show that overall creditor 
recovery rates are higher, and unsecured creditor recoveries and 
post-bankruptcy survival rates are not different, when bankrupt firms 
sell businesses as going concerns.</div>

 has been a systematic decline in the number of publicly-traded firms 
over the last two decades, and half of the U.S. industries have lost 
over 50% of their publicly traded peers. The decline has increased 
industry concentration, as the void left by public firms has not been 
filled by an increase in the number of private businesses or by greater 
presence of foreign firms. Furthermore, this phenomenon has 
significantly changed the nature of public firms.  Firms in industries 
with the largest decline in the number of public firms have generated 
higher profit margins and abnormal stock returns, and enjoyed better

 are downturns following episodes of high asset values so detrimental to

attempt a different explanation of the causes and consequences of debt 
overhang. In doing so, we also differentiate between the control rights 
over assets, which are sufficient to enforce external claims only in a 
boom, and control rights over cash flows that enable the enforcement of 
external claims in a downturn. It is the change in the relevant control 
rights that makes it so hard to renegotiate debt efficiently, and causes
 the debt build up to have long-drawn adverse effects in the downturn</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21545_abstract">The
 composition of corporate borrowing between bank loans and publicly 
traded debt varies substantially, both across firms and over the 
business cycle. This paper develops a new model of firm dynamics, where 
firms choose both the scale and composition of their borrowing, in order
 to understand the aggregate implications of corporate debt choices. In 
choosing debt composition, firms trade-off the flexibility that banks 
provide in case of financial distress, with the lower intermediation 
costs offered by markets in normal times. The steady-state of the model 
captures key cross-sectional facts about debt composition: firms sort 
between a mixed-debt and a market-debt regime, and shift from the former
 to the latter as their credit risk declines. Aggregate shocks to banks'
 intermediation costs generate a large recession, accompanied by a sharp
 drop in the total share of intermediation conducted by banks. In this 
model, the aggregate decline in borrowing and investment reflects not 
only lower bank loan issuance by mixed-debt firms (the traditional 
``lending channel"), but also a reduction in total borrowing by a subset
 firms that retire bank loans and issue publicly traded debt in their 
place (a new ``substitution channel''). When replacing loans by public 
debt, these firms indeed lose the flexibility provided by banks in bad 
times; they attempt to offset this increase in financial fragility by 
deleveraging. I show that this mechanism can be quantitatively large, 
accounting for as much as a third of the decline in investment among 
rated firms in the Great Recession.</div>

areas where banks do not own branches. Moreover, banks increase sales of
 more-liquid loans in order to lessen the impact of the demand shock on 
credit supply. Larger, multi-market banks appear better able than

 study general equilibrium asset prices in a multi-period endowment 
economy when agents’ risk aversion is allowed to depend on the horizon 
of the risk. In our pseudo-recursive preference framework, agents are 
time inconsistent for intra- temporal tradeoffs but time consistent for 
inter-temporal tradeoffs. Under standard log-normal consumption growth, 
we find that horizon-dependent risk aversion affects the pricing of risk
 if and only if volatility is stochastic. When risk aversion decreases 
with the horizon – as indicated by lab experiments – and the elasticity 
of intertemporal substitution is greater than 1, our model results in a 
downward sloping term structure of risk prices. The model can therefore 
explain the recent empirical results on the term structure of risky

We investigate how the displacement risk associated with import 
competition is reflected in the cost of capital. We use shipping costs 
to measure the vulnerability of U.S. industries to import competition. 
We find that output and employment in high exposure industries is more 
sensitive to tariff cuts than in low exposure industries, consistent 
with the idea that they face a higher risk of being displaced by import 
competition. We then show that high exposure industries have a higher 
cost of capital. We confirm displacement risk of import competition is 
priced and covaries with the marginal utility of the representative 
agent.</div>

 competition is a significant source of time-varying risk premia in

Endogenous countercyclical
markups slow down demand and recoveries during downturns while 
procyclical profits render financial assets risky. The model predicts a

 with financial frictions have been shown to create amplification and 
persistence effects in macroeconomic fluctuations. We test the ability 
that Costly State Verification (CSV) has to generate empirically 
plausible risk exposures in asset markets, when households have Epstein 
and Zin (1989) preferences and productivity shocks are in the style of 
Long Run Risks. Under the setup of Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), 
alongside these mechanisms, we find that the CSV friction is negligible 
in augmenting the aggregate equity premium. Additionally we find that 
the separation between the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and 
risk aversion plays a key role in explaining financial market dynamics; 
in particular, we are only able to generate sizable equity premium when 
the elasticity is greater than one. Moreover, while the contracting 
friction provides volatility to the price of capital, its contribution 
is not significant. Instead physical adjustment costs of capital are 
much more meaningful in reaching realistic quantitative targets.</div>

 study “donor governance,” which occurs when contributors to non-profit 
firms place restrictions on their gifts to limit the discretion of 
managers.  In a study of U.S. art museums, I find that this practice has
 grown significantly in recent years, and it represents the largest 
source of permanent capital in the industry.  When donor restrictions 
are strong, museums shift their cost structures away from administration
 and toward program services, and they exhibit very high savings rates, 
retaining in their endowments 45 cents of each incremental dollar 
donated.  Retention rates are near zero for cash generated from other 
activities.  Restricted donations appear to stabilize non-profits and 
significantly influence their activities, but they reduce management 
flexibility and may contribute to lower profit margins.  Rising donor 
governance in U.S. art museums may represent a reaction by contributors 
to the industry’s high rates of financial distress, weak boards of 
trustees, and large private benefits of control enjoyed by managers.</div>

 boards are comprised of individual directors but make decisions as a

 Groupthink is described as a mode of thinking by highly cohesive groups
 where the desire for consensus and agreement by the group members 
potentially overrides critical thinking and correct judgment.  Based on 
the idea that greater overlap and interaction among group members leads 
to greater group cohesiveness which, in turn, leads to greater 
groupthink, we develop and empirically deploy four proxies for 
groupthink.  We hypothesize that (i) groupthink negatively affects firm 
value, and (ii) groupthink will have a more negative effect on firm

Due to non-linear transaction costs, the financial performance of a 
trading strategy decreases with portfolio size. Using a dynamic trading 
model a la Garleanu-Pedersen (2012), we derive closed-form formulas for 
the performance-to-scale frontier reached by a trader endowed with a 
signal predicting stock returns. The decay with scale of the realized 
Sharpe ratio is slower for strategies that (1) trade more liquid stocks 
(2) are based on signals that do not fade away quickly and (3) have 
strong frictionless performance. For an investor ready to accept a 
Sharpe reduction by 30%, portfolio scale (measured in dollar volatility)
 is given by SR*/(10 lambda phi)^2, where SR* is the frictionless 
Sharpe, lambda a measure of price impact, and phi a measure of the speed
 at which the signal fades away. We apply the framework to four 
well-known strategies. Because stocks have become more liquid, the 
capacity of strategies has increased in the 2000s compared to the 1990s.
 Due to high signal persistence, the capacity of a ``quality" strategy 
is an order of magnitude larger than the others and is the only one 
highly scalable in the mid-cap range. </div>

 a comprehensive dataset of stock holdings by hedge funds, we examine 
the role of hedge funds in the price formation process. Compared to 
other institutional investors, hedge funds tend to hold stocks that plot
 above the security market plane, i.e., positive-alpha stocks. Focusing 
on positive-alpha stocks provides a setting in which theory makes clear 
predictions about how arbitrageurs should hold and trade mispriced 
assets, and how their activities should predict future stock returns. We
 find that in the cross-section of stocks, hedge fund ownership and 
trades are positively related to the degree of mispricing and arbitrage 
costs. A portfolio of positive-alpha stocks with high hedge fund 
ownership generates an out-of-sample risk-adjusted return of 0.48% per 
month, significantly higher than a counterpart of low hedge fund 
ownership. Hedge fund ownership and trades also precede the dissipation 
of positive alpha. By contrast, all these patterns are nonexistent or 
much weaker in stocks held by non-hedge fund institutions. The findings 
are robust to alternative benchmark models and alpha measures. Overall, 
our results suggest that hedge funds exploit and reduce stock 
mispricing.</div>

 paper investigates empirically whether uncertainty about the expected 
returns on the market portfolio can explain the performance of hedge 
funds both in the cross-section and over time. We measure uncertainty 
via volatility of aggregate volatility (VOV) and construct an investable
 version of this measure by computing monthly returns on lookback 
straddles written on the VIX index. We find that VOV exposure is a 
significant determinant of hedge fund returns at the overall index 
level, at different strategy levels, and at an individual fund level. We
 find that funds with low (more negative) VOV betas outperform funds 
with high VOV betas by 1.62% per month. After controlling for a large 
set of fund characteristics, we document a robust and significant 
negative risk premium for VOV exposure in the cross-section of hedge 
fund returns. We further show that strategies with less negative VOV 
betas outperform their counterparts during the financial crisis period 
when uncertainty about expected returns was at its highest. On the 
contrary, strategies with more negative VOV betas generate superior 
returns when uncertainty in the market is less. Furthermore, the 
variation in the VOV betas is consistent with the risk-taking incentives
 of hedge funds arising from the different fund characteristics

 analyze the relation between the location of a pension fund in its 
network and the investment performance, risk taking, and flows of the 
fund. Our approach analyzes the centrality of the fund's management 
company by examining the number of connections it has with other 
management companies through their commonality in managing for the same 
fund sponsors or through the same fund consultants. Network centrality 
is found to be positively associated with risk-adjusted return 
performance and growth in assets under management, after controlling for
 size and past performance, for domestic asset classes; however, we do 
not find this relation for foreign equity holdings. These findings 
indicate that local information advantages, which are much stronger 
among managers holding locally based stocks, exhibit positive 
externalities among connected managers. Of particular note is that we do
 not find that the centrality of a manager within one asset class (e.g.,
 domestic bonds) helps the performance of the manager in another asset 
class (e.g., domestic equity), further indicating that our network 
analysis uncovers information diffusion effects. Network connections 
established through consultants are found to be particularly significant
 in explaining performance and fund flows, consistent with consultants 
acting as an important information conduit through which managers learn 
about each other's actions. Moreover, the importance of network 
centrality is strongest for larger funds, controlling for any economic 
scale effects. Better connected funds are also better able to attract 
higher net inflows for a given level of past return performance. 
Finally, more centrally placed fund managers are less likely to be fired
 after spells of low performance. Our results indicate that networks in 
asset management are one key source of the dissemination of private 
information about security values.</div>

 decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) market generates a trading network
 among dealers. In this paper, I model the driver behind the formation 
of this inter-dealer network (the selling network in particular) as the 
need for dealers to share risk. The trade-off between the benefit of 
risk-sharing and the funding cost of collateral determines the shape of 
the inter-dealer network. In equilibrium, dealers’ markups and trading 
volumes increase with the number of links they have to other dealers, 
whereas dealers’ inventory risks decrease as they form links. In 
addition, when capacity of providing liquidity differentiates dealers, 
the network formed exhibits the empirically observed core- periphery 
structure. Specifically, dealers with large capacity comprise the core 
of the network, connecting them to all other dealers, while dealers who 
have small capacity operate at the periphery. My model matches recent 
empirical findings on the negative relationship between order sizes and 
markups. More importantly, I show that there may be structural breaks in
 this negative relationship as variations in order sizes may alter the 
inter-dealer network. These results suggest that empirical studies on 
OTC markets should control for the stability of an inter- dealer network
 to avoid model misspecification.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20724_abstract">We
 analyze conditions under which fund managers herd to acquire 
information and trade on the same stock. This happens when fund managers
 have highly complementary signals, that is each manager has very 
imprecise information but taken together they have perfect information. 
However, the number of managers herding on the same stock cannot exceed 
three due to competition. When information sharing in a social network 
is introduced among managers, herding can occur for arbitrary number of 
managers and the set of parameters under which herding occurs is 
strictly larger.  The benefit of social network increases with the 
social network size for highly complementary information. The optimal 
social network size decreases with the precision of managers' signals. 
With social network, fund managers can act in unison and maximize their 
combined profits.  We then allow information sharing to be noisy and 
show that noisy communication of signals can be optimal and further 
expanding the set of parameters for herding to be optimal.  We extend 
our model to multi-period and continuous time trading and show that our 
main results still go through in dynamic trading although the 
opportunity set that favors herding will be smaller due to more 
intensive competition. In addition, in continuous time trading, 
investors will not herd unless there is a social network to share 
information. However, they will never share their information to all in 
the network due to the resulting rat race among the managers.</div>

novel empirical strategy for investigating this sort of cross-stock

 operator (LASSO). When we apply this technique to minute-by-minute NYSE

 increases out-of-sample return predictability by 38%. What’s more, this
 cross-stock information is sparse. Each stock’s returns are typically 
affected by the returns of only 12 other stocks at any point in time,

This Foreign Industry Bias is akin to a “Home Bias Abroad” and explains 
between 13% and 47% of foreign benchmark deviations. The bias is 
associated with superior performance primarily driven by stock-picking 
within foreign industries by funds with a simultaneous “Home Bias” in

 active local country funds when investing in large domestic industries

 estimates of a housing supply schedule must offer a solution to the 
twin problems of simultaneity and non-stationarity that plague the time 
series data for local housing prices and stock. A Vector Error 
Correction Model (VECM) is suggested to handle both the non-stationarity
 and endogeneity problems. This model also nicely distinguishes between 
(very) long-run elasticities and a variety of short-term impacts. We 
estimate this model separately for 68 US MSAs using quarterly data on 
housing prices and residential construction permits since 1980. We also 
estimate a single equation. Error Correction Model (ECM) for house 
prices in which stock is exogenous in order to test the robustness of 
prices to alternative stock growth scenarios. The results of both models
 provide long-run supply elasticity estimates for each market that are 
better bounded than previous panel based attempts and also correspond 
with much conventional thought. We find these elasticities are well 
explained by geographic and regulatory barriers, and that inelastic 
markets exhibit greater price volatility over the last two decades. 
Using the models’ short- run dynamics we make several forecasts of 
prices over the next decade. In current dollars, some MSAs will still 
not recover to recent peak (2007) house price levels by 2024, while 
others should exceed it by as much as 40%.</div>

strong cross-correlations, invalidating the use of first generation

control for unobserved heterogeneity exploiting repeat listings, b) 
their use of censored durations (listings that are expired and/or

first index computes proportional displacements in the home sale

 supply constrained markets have seen more, not less, construction than

 Supply constraints are highly correlated with historical education 
levels, immigration, and national growth in local industries. Using 
constraints to form instrumental variables for home prices thus does not

 cross data on self-reported and market house values to present

 about future inflation adversely affects economic decisions and 
well-being of both businesses and consumers. It is therefore important 
that monetary policy-makers carefully assess and forecast inflation 
uncertainty. In this study, we consider the three post-communist 
countries -- Poland, Russia, and Ukraine -- and the US as a benchmark 
for comparison of our findings. The data are monthly and cover 
1994-2012. We derive measures of inflation uncertainty from the 
distribution of ex-post (pseudo out of sample) forecast errors. Among 
the three post-communist countries, only Poland conducted a reasonably 
successful monetary policy with a clearly defined inflation target. 
Russia, although officially pursuing inflation stabilization, was, in 
fact, targeting exchange rate stabilization, which resulted in inflation
 fueled by a ‘dirty float.’ Ukraine’s monetary policy was the least 
transparent: the exchange rate targeting was followed by the exchange 
rate pegging and then by inflation targeting. The study uses a novel 
econometric technique for modelling macroeconomic uncertainty with the 
use of the weighted skew normal &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(WSN) distribution. The advantage of this approach is that the 
parameters of the estimated WSN distribution are directly interpretable 
in the context of monetary policy. Our results show that WSN provides a 
good fit for Poland and the US (the estimated probabilities of hitting 
the inflation target are about 60 percent), but not for Russia and 
Ukraine. Furthermore, the estimates of the distributional parameters 
suggest the prevalence of anti-inflationary policy over the 
output-stimulating policy for Poland, while the opposite seems to be 
true for the US.</div>

 Ruble is of critical importance for the Russian economy. Since January 
2014, the currency lost 50 percent of its value against the US Dollar. 
Similarly, the Ukranian Hryvnia lost about two thirds of its value. The 
fall of both currencies started with the military conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine, and may be insofar shaped by the sanctions imposed 
by Western countries against Russia. However, oil prices also declined 
since summer 2014. Since Russia is heavily dependent on natural 
resources, the oil price decline can be another factor behind the 
deterioration. By using high frequency data on nominal exchange rates 
and news concerning the conflict and the introduction of sanctions, we 
explore the driving forces of the exchange rate dynamics in both 
countries. The analysis is based on VAR models, where fundamental long 
run relationships are taken into account. The results indicate that the 
bulk of the depreciations is caused by the decline of oil prices. Short 
run dynamics are mainly driven by conflict news. While both exchange 
rates appear to be cointegrated, the Ruble is weakly exogenous to the 
long run relationship.</div>

 estimate four different types of monetary policy reaction functions for
 Russia from January 2000 until January 2015 using a monthly data gives 
us 170 observations. Our contributions are manifold. We are able to show
 that for the whole data sample money-based rules, such as McCallum 
rule, provide more accurate depiction of Russia’s monetary policy. This 
result is familiar also from many other emerging market countries. 
However, also Taylor rule garners some support when estimations are done
 for the whole sample. To complement the analysis, we perform rolling 
regressions for the monetary rules. From the estimations we can see that
 Russia’s monetary policy has changed over years. Price-based monetary 
policy instruments have become more important, and Taylor rule seems to 
depict actual conduct of monetary policy better. Perhaps even more 
significantly, in recent times Russia’s monetary policy seems to react 
e.g. to oil price shocks in the manner predicted by standard 
macroeconomic theories. Therefore, our results shows that Russia’s 
monetary policy has undergone significant changes during the past two 
years, which corresponds also to the rhetoric of the central bank.</div>

 examine regional wage differentials and their dynamics in Poland from 
1994 to 2007. This period takes us from the beginning of robust economic
 growth in Poland following the transitional shock therapy of the 
Balcerowicz Plan, through Poland’s accession to the EU up until the 
Financial Crisis. We use annual micro data from the Polish Labor Force 
Surveys to estimate regional wage differentials, controlling for a large
 number of observed worker characteristics. We find that 
composition-corrected regional wage differentials persist throughout 
this period with little evidence of persistent convergence due to labor 
migration or firm location decisions. In fact, wage dispersion across 
regions is found to increase substantially after 2001 such that wage 
dispersion in 2007 was greater than in 2004. 

In the second part of the paper we use the estimated annual regional 
relative wage coefficients as the dependent variable in an exploratory 
examination of the determinants of inter-regional wage premiums in 
Poland. We are able to use region-specific price data to examine both 
nominal and real relative wage patterns. New economic geography theory 
hypothesizes a positive correlation between wage differentials and 
proximity to large foreign and domestic markets. On the other hand, 
spatial equilibrium models emphasize the effects of worker movements in 
response to local amenities. Our cross-region empirical analysis finds 
that regional nominal and real wage differentials are negatively 
correlated with the region’s distance from Warsaw and Brussels and 
positively related to location on the Baltic coast and the EU border, 
which we interpret as evidence for the market proximity hypothesis. In 
addition, wage differentials are responsive to migration factors -- 
lower in regions with greater housing supply and a warmer climate and 
higher in regions with higher rates of international emigration. There 
is no evidence that the impact of cross-region relative wage 
determinants changed with Poland's entry into the EU.</div>

 the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, government and industry have invested 
over $1 trillion to abate water pollution, or $100 per person-year. But 
over half of US stream and river miles still have water quality so poor 
that they violate standards. This paper assembles the most comprehensive
 set of files ever compiled on water quality and its determinants to 
study changes in water pollution since the Clean Water Act, their 
causes, and their welfare consequences. The paper obtains three sets of 
findings. First, most types of water pollution have fallen dramatically 
since 1972, though were declining at nearly the same rate before then. 
Second, we study the contribution of the Clean Water Act to these 
declines. Third, we compare the willingness-to-pay for these declines in
 water pollution, as measured through the housing market, against their 
costs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14533_abstract">In this paper we exploit a unique panel database that was constructed over the course of
several years for the purpose of examining the relationship between lake water quality and 
recreation.  A random sample of Iowa residents provided information on recreation visits made to 
lakes in the state for the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2009.  Trip records were gathered for 
each time period using annual surveys containing identical questions on individuals’ visits to each 
of 127 primary lakes in the state. To our knowledge this is the only micro level, spatially 
explicit, panel recreation database in existence. At the same time that the behavioral data was 
gathered a coordinated limnology survey of lakes in the state was undertaken.  This effort provided 
water quality measures for the primary lakes in Iowa for the same years that we surveyed behavior.
Thus in addition to the panel feature of the visitation data, we are able to match water quality 
measures at spatial and temporal scales that correspond to the destination and timing of our trip 
observations.  These two features of our data allow us to convincingly overcome the endogeneity and 
measurement error problems that have threatened the validity of previous revealed preference 
studies.
We first carry out several analyses designed to measure the causal effect of water quality on 
recreation behavior.  We find convincing evidence that better water quality leads to a higher 
likelihood that an individual will visit a particular lake. For our preferred specifications the 
elasticity of participation with respect to water quality is consistently around 0.09.  We also 
find evidence that better water quality leads to a higher frequency of visits to a destination. 
With a causal relationship established we then use a simple structural model to measure visitors’ 
willingness to pay for lake water</div>

assessment of the aggregate trends in water quality in the U.S. using a single standard
over the years 1975 to 2011. The analysis suggests that fresh water lakes for the nation as
a whole are about at the same quality levels as they were in 1975. In short, viewed in the
aggregate, nothing has changed. An assessment of the factors influencing the aggregates
also suggests that water quality appears to be affected by the business cycle. This result

economic growth that are associated with the Environmental Kuznets Curve.</div>

As cost minimizers, limit facilities face no incentive to deviate from this standard. Using
novel datasets on wastewater treatment facilities, we show that bans have weak effects on
phosphorous effluent, especially in the most polluted waterways.</div>

an outcome of the ability of the emergent elite to appropriate cereal crops from farmers and
not a result of land productivity, as argued by conventional theory. We argue that cereals are
easier to appropriate than roots and tubers, and that regional di§erences in the suitability of
land for di§erent crops explain therefore di§erences in the formation of hierarchy and states. A
simple model illustrates our main theoretical argument. Our empirical investigation shows that
land suitability for cereals relative to suitability for tubers explains the formation of hierarchical
institutions and states, whereas land productivity does not.</div>

 the Neolithic Revolution, seven populations independently invented 
agriculture. In this paper, I argue that this innovation was a response 
to a large increase in climatic seasonality. Unable to find food during 
the cold or dry season, hunter-gatherers in the most affected regions 
became sedentary in order to store food and smooth their consumption. 
Sedentarism and storage are preconditions for any successful 
agricultural society, so these adaptations made the invention of 
agriculture more likely. I present a model capturing the key incentives 
for adopting agriculture, and I test the resulting predictions against a
 global panel dataset of climate conditions and Neolithic adoption 
dates. I find that invention and adoption were both systematically more 
likely in places with higher seasonality. The findings of this paper 
imply that seasonality patterns 10,000 years ago were amongst the major 
determinants of the present day global distribution of crop 
productivities, ethnic groups, cultural traditions, and political 
institutions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21836_abstract">India's
 rivers are heavily polluted. One of the most polluted sites is the 
river Ganges as it runs through the city of Kanpur. The river receives 
large amounts of toxic waste from the city's domestic and industrial 
sectors. The tannery industry in particular, unleashes highly toxic 
pollutants into the river. We study the impact of a landmark piece of 
environmental legislation in this city. M C Mehta v Union of India 
ordered the tanneries to either clean its waste or shut down. The local 
municipality was required to clean city sewers and reduce the level of 
water pollution. We explore the mortality burden of this ruling in 
Kanpur district as well as districts downstream. We find a decline in 
Kanpur's rate of infant mortality immediately after the verdict. The 
decline in mortality also extends downstream. To explore the extent to 
which river pollution may affect children's mortality, we expand our 
sample to the set of all Indian districts with major rivers. Since 
pollution may be endogenous, we construct an instrument for water 
quality using water quality upstream of that district. Two-stage least 
squares (2SLS) regression reveals a positive district-level association 
between one-month infant mortality and the concentration of fecal 
coliforms in river water. This association strongly holds for both 
national demographic surveys that we use to compile infant mortality 
data. We interpret the association to be causal: The average effect of a
 one-percent increase in fecal coliforms is an additional 3-5 deaths per
 100,000 births in a given month. In comparison, the corresponding 
downstream infant mortality impact is approximately 1-2 deaths per 
100,000 births.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21839_abstract">Over
 the last decade, there has been a strong push to expand access to 
life-saving antiretroviral drugs. This expansion of access has 
contributed to a decline in HIV-related mortality and has had 
substantial welfare impacts. One of the debates regarding the effects of
 ARV rollout is the impact on preventive behavior, and in particular on 
HIV testing. Treatment availability has two main implications for HIV 
testing: first it may affect the number of testers (‘level’ effect), and
 second it may affect the composition of testers (‘selection’ effect). 
Theoretical predictions about the level effect are ambiguous: more 
people may get tested because treatment availability increases the value
 of knowing one’s HIV status but increasing access to treatment reduces 
the costs of contracting HIV, which in turn reduces the perceived 
importance of timely engagement in preventive behavior (de Walque, 
2011). The predictions about the selection effect are clearer: treatment
 availability should lead to more HIV+ and others with greater expected 
returns to treatment selecting into treatment. If on average individuals
 who test in response to treatment availability are more likely to be 
HIV positive, this has implications for disease spread. We offer an 
alternative approach by using a dataset that combines data on 
clinic-level ARV availability in Lilongwe, Malawi over the course of ARV
 expansion, with rich clinic-month data on the number and composition of
 testers. This dataset affords us a unique opportunity to study how HIV 
testing responds to increased availability of treatment. It also allows 
us to study clinic level spillovers. Despite its importance, 
clinic-level spillovers of ARV availability in one clinic on use of 
services at nearby clinics have not been previously studied. Using rich 
clinic-month data, we study the effect of the introduction of ART on HIV
 testing rates and the composition of testers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21729_abstract">We
 extend the literature on price dispersion both empirically and 
theoretically: First, we use a comprehensive dataset on US retail 
pricing to document that there exists significant dispersion in the 
overall price level across stores, as well as in the prices of 
individual goods relative to the store average. While the overall 
price-level varies by approximately 6% across stores, the prices of 
individual goods vary by as much as 14% around the store average, making
 the latter form of ’relative price dispersion’ dominant. This suggests 
non-trivial scope for households to economize by visiting multiple 
stores and buying goods where they are cheapest. To rationalize these 
observations, we propose a novel theory of equilibrium multi-product 
search. Relative price dispersion arises in the model as a result of 
spatial price discrimination by stores seeking to take advantage in 
heterogeneity households’ willingness to shop around for individual 
goods.</div>

 paper proposes a framework for studying how consumer search and 
multiproduct purchase affect retail market structure. To provide 
one-stop shopping convenience and attract more consumers, single-product
 shops supplying different products can merge to form a multiproduct 
retailer. The merger, however, also changes the market structure and 
affects price competition. When the search friction is not too high, the
 equilibrium market structure is asymmetric and multiproduct and 
single-product retailers coexist. This often leads to the weakest price 
competition and is the worst for consumers among all possible market 
structures. Due to the endogeneity of the market structure, reducing the
 search friction does not necessarily induce lower market prices and 
higher consumer welfare.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21731_abstract">Almost
 all retailers offer multiple products, and consumers search for low 
prices on a basket of goods. Kaplan and Menzio (2014) document a great 
deal of price dispersion both within and across stores offering multiple
 products. This paper extends Burdett and Judd (1983), a canonical model
 of equilibrium price dispersion, to the case of multiple products. As 
shown in Burdett and Malueg (1981), when sequentially searching for 
multiple products, consumers (a) face a lower cost of search per good 
and (b) may capitalize on low prices for one good while continuing to 
search for an acceptable price on the others. This leads multi-product 
consumers to set one reservation price for a basket of goods, and a 
higher (per good) reservation price for each good alone. This paper 
characterizes firms' pricing decisions in light of this search behavior.
 In a simple version of the model where all firms offer every good, the 
marginal distribution of each price is unique and of the same form as 
would obtain in a simple single product model, and any joint 
distribution with support contained in the acceptance set of consumers 
satisfies equilibrium. This provides theoretical foundation for the 
common empirical focus on marginal price distributions -- as only these 
are determined in equilibrium. While the structure of equilibrium is 
unaffected by the addition of single good demanders, the addition of 
single good firms can lead to one of several pricing patterns depending 
on parameters. A consistent prediction is that, if enough firms can 
offer only a single good, these single product firms crowd out the 
bottom of the price distribution, with the interesting equilibrium 
effect of also lowering the highest prices charged by multi-product 
firms -- an effect which would not obtain in the single product case. 
Various comparative statics are considered.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21732_abstract">Motivated
 by observed patterns in business-to-business transactions, we develop a
 dynamic model of pricing and buyer search. Seller costs are perfectly 
correlated and evolve according to a Markov process. In every period, 
each buyer observes (for free) the price set by their current supplier, 
but not the other sellers' prices or the sellers' (common) cost level. 
Moreover, by paying a cost $s$ the buyer becomes a searcher and benefits
 from (Bertrand) competition among sellers. We show that there exists a 
semi-separating equilibrium whereby sellers increase price very rapidly 
when costs increase but decrease price very slowly when costs decrease. 
Moreover, buyers search when prices increase but not otherwise. These 
patterns are consistent with two stylized facts: (a) prices adjust to 
cost changes asymmetrically ("rockets and feathers"); and (b) buyers 
search in response to large price increases. Finally, contrary to the 
intuition that more information is beneficial, we find that pooling 
equilibria (where prices reveal no information) Pareto dominate 
separating equilibria.</div>

 seek to enter a productive relationship with agents by posting general 
incentive contracts. A contract must solve both the ex post moral hazard

posting is optimal; the optimal contract is characterized and includes 
compensatory transfers to agents who meet a principal but fail to

 is immune to principal competition and so implements the standard

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21768_abstract">This
 paper explores price formation when sellers are privately informed both
 about their preferences and the quality of their asset.  In 
equilibrium, sellers recognize that it will be harder to sell their 
asset at higher prices, while buyers recognize that they will get higher
 quality assets on average at higher prices.  The model has many 
equilibria, including one in which all trade takes place at one price.  
Under a behavioral restriction, we find a unique semi-separating 
equilibrium in which trade takes place over an interval of prices.  We 
characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for this equilibrium to
 be Pareto optimal.  Efficient allocations may require transfers across

 research proximity effects from permanent station opening grew for

absent today. Second, proximity to station-based innovations affected 
local farmers' productivity for 20 to 40 years after the discovery. 
Third, research proximity effects remain today where stations

 health care expenditures are high, currently around 18 percent of GDP, 
and they are growing.   Most of what we know about the causes of health 
spending growth began with Newhouse (1992), which decomposed health 
spending growth by insurance, income, demographics, and a residual 
referred to as “technology.”  It showed that technology is the largest 
driver of health spending growth and that insurance only explains about 
ten percent.  Subsequent work by Finkelstein (2007) found that the 
spread of insurance explains much more of the increase in health 
spending, around 50 percent.  Both studies used different sources of 
variation to examine the role of insurance: Newhouse relied on partial 
equilibrium variation from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, and 
Finkelstein relied on general equilibrium variation from the inception 
of Medicare.  

We revisit the role of insurance in explaining health spending growth 
using variation from the inception and subsequent expansion of Medicaid,
 which induced more general equilibrium variation than the Rand Health 
Insurance Experiment but potentially less general equilibrium variation 
than the inception of Medicare. We construct a new calculator that 
includes rich variation in Medicaid eligibility across states, across 
demographic groups, and across time from the inception of Medicaid in 
1965 to the present.   Using all legislative variation in our 
calculator, we find that insurance explains about 20 percent of the 
overall growth in total health care spending from 1964 to the present.  
Our Medicaid variation allows us to dig deeper into the mechanisms for 
how insurance affects health spending growth by isolating the impact of 
various subsets of the full variation.  We find that Medicaid expansions
 to adults explain a much greater share of health spending growth than 
expansions to children.  We also examine mechanisms by examining several
 alternative measures of health spending and its components, which we 
compiled from a wide variety of sources.   We find evidence that 
Medicaid increased health spending growth through spillovers to private 
spending.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13857_abstract">To
 judge the efficiency of the U.S. Medicare program, many researchers 
have asked the seemingly simple question: What is the health consequence
 of an incremental Medicare dollar? Using a wide array of research 
designs, cohorts, and outcomes, studies have demonstrated a wide range 
of estimates. Some estimate a positive association between spending and 
outcomes, and others show a paradoxical negative association.  We 
reconsider this question in Medicare fee-for-service heart attack 
patients from 2007-11, a period of stagnant Medicare cost growth.  We 
demonstrate theoretically that in the presence of productive 
inefficiency –hospitals use too little effective care, or too much 
inefficient care -- empirical estimates of the marginal productivity of 
health care spending are not informative. Instead, we develop a model of
 productive and allocative efficiency, and test it using a novel dataset
 with hospital-year data on treatments ranging from those with 
documented effectiveness (e.g., beta blocker and statin use) to those 
with documented poor efficiency (e.g., home health care predictive of 
fraud). A remarkably large degree of productive inefficiency across 
hospitals can be explained solely by differences in input choices. 
Medicare expenditures yield substantial value in some hospital systems, 
but other hospitals (those that underuse effective treatments and 
overuse expensive treatments with little evidence of clinical 
effectiveness) display low returns to spending. Reassuringly, hospitals 
that reduced spending on heart attack patients during this period 
experienced survival gains equal to hospitals increasing spending.</div>

 growth rate of medical spending in the United States has experienced a 
marked slowdown in recent years. It is unclear whether this is due to 
the recent recession, structural changes embedded in the Affordable Care
 Act or other factors. Studying the impact of the recession on medical 
care use and spending at the individual level will provide insight on 
this question. We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
Household Component (MEPS-HC) from 2007 to 2012 together with state and 
county measures of economic activity to analyze quarterly medical care 
use and spending. We examine each of the following categories: 
hospitalization; emergency room visits; ambulatory medical visits; home 
health visits; and prescription medications. We separately examine 
spending by source, including total vs. out of pocket spending. Our 
method of analysis follows the literature on the impact of the 
macroeconomy on health: we examine how changes within state or county 
over time in our key independent variables (state or county level 
unemployment rates) affects medical care use and spending.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14191_abstract">We ask how work schedule instability and unpredictability are associated with the relatively
neglected side of hours constraints – preferences for additional hours of work that are
not provided by the employer – among workers paid by the hour. Schedule instability and
unpredictability undermine workers’ actual and perceived economic security, fueling a desire
to work additional hours for additional pay. At the same time, employers seek to match
hours worked to variations in demand, while they also screen for workers willing to provide
high levels of work intensity (that is, to work only when the value of the marginal product
is greater than the wage -- roughly, when dem d is expected to be high). We hypothesize
that this is associated with underemploymen mployers exercise their autonomous
preferences for short hours, while some workers accept labor intensity and instability,
hoping for more hours and greater economic security. We use data from Canada’s 2003
Workplace and Employee Survey (WES), a representative survey of business locations and
their employees. The WES is well suited to test our hypotheses because it includes both
information on hours constraints and measures of schedule instability and unpredictability.
Having documented that unstable and unpredictable schedules are strongly associated with
involuntary underemployment, we proceed to ask whether workers on such schedules are
rewarded with additional hours (or higher wages), using a fixed effects model. Because the
WES provides a two-year panel, we can test whether unstable schedules with insufficient
hours are stepping-stones to higher incomes and greater economic security.</div>

 past three decades have been marked by a scholarly debate concerning 
the relationship between Islam and democracy. Nonetheless, the picture 
to be drawn is not coherent as a considerable number of studies argue 
that Islam and democracy should not be considered mutually exclusive 
(Esposito and Voll 1996, Salame 1994), while other studies note that 
Islam acts as a significant obstacle to democratic forms of government 
and/or democratic values and ideals (Fukuyama 1992, Huntington 1996, 
Potrafke 2012). However, constitutions differ among Muslim-majority 
countries and by no means all Muslim-majority countries exhibit an 
“Islamic Constitution”. By using a newly developed coding of the degree 
to which Muslim-majority countries incorporate Islam into their 
constitutions, we investigate the relationship between Islam and 
democracy in Muslim-Majority countries. Our dependent variable is The 
Democracy-Dictatorship measure of political regimes by Cheibub et al. 
(2010). Our main independent variables are: a measure related to Islam 
as a source of legislation, and another for the supremacy of Islam 
within constitutions. Our control variables include per capita GDP, oil 
production, education, and degree of globalization.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14528_abstract">The
 paper develops a framework for analyzing the economic analysis of the 
highway network of the proposed Development Corridor for Egypt. The 
analysis is based on the interregional computable general equilibrium 
model (ICGE) model for Egypt’s economy that was developed by Haddad et 
al., (2015). An important feature of our MCGE model is its ability to 
explicit estimate costs of moving products based on origin-destination 
pairs according to transportation margins. That is, the model accounts 
for the specific cost structure of the flow of each traded commodity. 
This paper innovates, by physically constrained that structure by the 
available transportation network, which is modeled in a stylized 
geo-coded transportation module. We examine the trade flows with and 
without the proposed Development Corridor. The model’s integration with a
 GIS network helps quantify the spatial effects of transportation cost 
change. Moreover it enables us to explicit model commodity-based 
transportation costs within the ICGE model, which are based on 
origin-destination flows. Thus, the model intrinsically accounts for the
 spatial structure of the Egyptian economy. That is, inclusion of the 
transportation network within the ICGE augments the general model 
framework for understanding the equilibrating role of transportation 
(and hence transportation investments) in regional economic development.
 &lt;br /&gt;
The transport module measures minimum travel times between regions using
 actual road routes. The ICGE model estimates the long-run spatial 
spread of national Gross Domestic Production (GDP) (and/or other 
measures of economic activity) caused by expected changes in regional 
economic activity. Combined it is possible to examine the spatial 
effects of transportation cost reductions in Egypt induced by 
transportation infrastructure improvements. We adopt a 
cost-competitiveness approach that reviews possible relative changes in 
the regional costs and on different demand structures.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14529_abstract">The paper analyses existing country-level information on the relationship between the
development of Islamic banking and financial inclusion. In Muslim countries—members
of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC)—various indicators of financial
inclusion tend to be lower, and the share of excluded individuals citing religious reasons
for not using bank accounts is noticeably greater than in other countries; Islamic banking
would therefore seem to be an effective avenue for financial inclusion. We found,
however, that although physical access to financial services has grown more rapidly in the
OIC countries, the use of these services has not increased as quickly. Moreover, regression
analyis shows evidence of a positive link to credit to households and to firms for financing
investment, but this empirical link remains tentative and relatively weak. The paper
explores reasons that this might be the case and suggests several recommendations to
enhance the ability of Islamic banking to promote financial inclusion.</div>

We endogenize aid-tying process by incorporating it into the donor’s optimization problem.
We analyze the dynamics of aid composition and show how different components

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14531_abstract">Arab
 countries (ACs) had started their developmental process a long time 
ago; however, they still suffer from numerous economic problems. The 
study quantify the contribution of socioeconomic reform programs in the 
Arab region over the past three decades on the growth pattern and 
development by estimating a conditional convergence equation. In 
addition, describe the development challenges facing the Arab Countries 
and examine the constraints of the development model in the region in 
terms of meeting these development challenges. &lt;br /&gt;
The Study used a quantitative method, which combines analytical, and 
econometrics methods. The model variables aim at explaining the 
differences across countries in the long-term level of GDP per capita, 
in addition to the composite economic reform indicators, as well as the 
physical infrastructure and human capital indicators. The originality of
 the study approach has consisted in generating aggregated reform 
indicators using principal component analysis. This methodology permits 
the aggregation of basic indicators in a more rigorous way than would a 
subjective scoring system. It also avoids multicollinearity problems 
when estimating an equation that includes several disaggregated 
indicators. &lt;br /&gt;
Economic reforms have been insufficient to boost the growth performance 
of the countries. This is the case for macroeconomic reforms, and for 
structural reforms during the entire period. On the other hand, the 
estimations reveal a low impact of some economic reforms. This is the 
case when structural reforms are implemented in a volatile macroeconomic
 and when macroeconomic reforms are implemented without a sufficient 
level of structural reform. &lt;br /&gt;
The empirical analysis carried out in this paper has clearly underlined 
the importance of economic reforms, human capital, and physical 
infrastructure to improve the growth prospects of the economies. These 
factors have been shown to have a powerful impact on growth. They have 
greatly contributed to the growth process in ACs.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14592_abstract">In
 1965 the Neighborhood Legal Services Program (LSP) was introduced as 
part of the War on Poverty to provide the poor with legal channels to 
remediate grievances, especially those resulting in riots. Historically,
 the poor had limited access to legal institutions due to financial 
constraints and discrimination. At the time, many viewed the lack of 
legal recourse produced demonstrations that escalated into riots in poor
 black communities. In response, the LSP was mandated to facilitate 
better relationships between poor blacks and the bureaucracies that they
 interacted with. This paper uses newly collected data on the 
communities receiving legal service grants in the between 1965 and 1975 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the federal anti-rioting program. 
Preliminary result shows that the legal service program was an effective
 program in reducing the likelihood of riots. Results also show that 
cities that received legal services grants are associated with higher 
property values by 1980 relative to cities that never received a legal 
services grant. Further analysis will look at voter turnout at local 
mayoral elections in the 1960s as well as state and national elections 
as a measure of community empowerment. So far these results are 
consistent with the historical narrative of legal service lawyer’s 
involvement in community empowerment and advocacy as well as the program
 effectiveness with mitigating the damages of riots that occurred in the
 1960s.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14593_abstract">Existing
 research on occupational segregation measures the degree of under- and 
overrepresentation of a group in an occupation given that group’s 
expected level of representation; the occupational crowding hypothesis 
posits that the expected level of representation is based on the share 
of the group with the educational attainment level possessed by the 
majority of the occupation’s workers (Bergmann 1971). Black men are 
overrepresented in low-wage occupations, and underrepresented in 
high-wage occupations, even after controlling for education (Bergmann 
1971; Gibson, Darity, and Myers 1998; Hamilton, Austin and Darity 2011).
  The occupational crowding hypothesis indicates that the crowding of 
black workers into low-wage occupations is due to: (1) employers’ desire
 not to associate with blacks; (2) employers’ perception that black 
workers are less productive; (3) employers’ fear of reprisal from white 
customers or employees.   Since occupational crowding research typically
 ignores the effect of business cycles on occupational sorting, this 
research examines whether the Great Recession exacerbated the 
occupational crowding of black men in the U.S. It also analyzes whether 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (ARRA) mitigated any
 reduction in black male representation in non-construction occupations 
impacted by ARRA contract funding; the most frequently cited 
non-construction jobs that were created/retained because of ARRA 
contract spending were in the engineering and architecture occupations. 
  

 This research examines whether the Great Recession exacerbated the 
occupational crowding of black men in the U.S. and whether (ARRA) 
mitigated any reduction in black male representation in non-construction
 occupations impacted by ARRA contract funding.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14594_abstract">The
 Stratification Economics literature largely attributes intergroup 
inequality to the social status of group membership. Specifically, 
individuals are social categorized into “in-groups” and “out-groups” 
such that the former and dominant group is endowed with a greater number
 of resources due to a higher social status as well as a number of 
persistent discriminatory policies towards the latter group. This theory
 has been used to explain intergroup inequality based on race, gender 
and ethnicity in the US. In the same spirit, this paper argues that the 
tools employed in the emerging subfield of Stratification Economics can 
also be utilized to explain the persistent and growing inequalities—in 
multiple dimensions including wealth, income, earnings, educational, 
occupational, and land ownership--between the Jewish majority and 
non-Jewish minority in Israel by extending the theory to incorporate 
national identity relative to the state’s identity.</div>

goods, and services. Over the same time period, DC enacted the nation’s 
most generous local Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) supplement for the 
working poor and near-poor, equivalent to 40 percent of the federal 
credit. Although the EITC is linked to increased employment, higher net 
income and liquidity, and lowered poverty, it is also possible that EITC
 receipt buffers against low-income out-migration from transitioning DC 
neighborhoods experiencing rising economic growth. To test this, we use 
longitudinal administrative tax panel data for DC from 2001 to 2013 to 
assess the combined effect of the DC supplemental earned income tax 
credit (EITC) and the federal EITC on geographic displacement and 
migration deriving from neighborhood economic growth (“gentrification”).
 We geocode the tax data to explore the influence of EITC policy on 
migration across Census tract, city neighborhood, and Ward. Data on the 
characteristics of residents are aggregated to provide indicators of 
economic change at the neighborhood level.  Given that the federal EITC 
is currently the nation’s largest federal cash transfer program for low 
and moderate income working families, the added liquidity low-income 
working DC families receive may have positive externalities extending to
 housing choice and location.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14506_abstract">The
 labor force participation of older adults in the US showed a marked 
increase over the last twenty years. Yet, the trend towards delayed 
retirement has not impacted all groups equally and large differences 
remain in labor force participation rates between those with low and 
high education. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, 
including restricted-access occupational codes matched with job demands 
information derived from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), 
this study examines what factors account for the educational differences
 in old-age employment. The results show that almost a half of the 
employment gap can be accounted for by differences in self-reported 
health and work-restricting health conditions.  Differences in 
demographics and self-reported job characteristics explain much of the 
remaining difference. By contrast, the impact of O*NET job demands is 
relatively small.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14507_abstract">In
 many occupations, both blue- and white-collar, abilities that decline 
relatively early in a worker’s life are very important.  Workers in 
these occupations may find it difficult to continue to work longer even 
if financial circumstances, like the increasing Full Retirement Age 
(FRA), dictate that they should.  Yet, past research on retirement 
timing has typically bucketed workers into the groups “blue-” and 
“white-” collar, even though this distinction ignores important 
differences in ability decline within each group.  Instead, this study 
uses the Health and Retirement Study linked to the O*NET job attributes 
to develop a “Susceptibility Index” to identify occupations that are 
especially vulnerable to ability decline prior to the FRA.  The study 
uses this Index to explore whether workers in occupations that value 
abilities that decline early will be forced to retire earlier, 
regardless of their financial circumstances and regardless of whether 
the occupation is blue- or white-collar.  It also uses the Index to 
explore whether workers have shifted into or away from jobs susceptible 
to early ability decline in the last two decades, as working longer has 
become more important.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14509_abstract">An
 increasing number of Americans are searching for a job at older ages.  
But job opportunities typically decline with age, with less-educated 
workers funneled into “old people jobs” like retail clerks, night 
watchmen, and crossing guards, while more-educated older workers find 
and retain employment in a broader range of occupations.  Using the 
Current Population Survey from 1994-2012 linked to job characteristics 
from O*Net, this paper examines the differences across occupations in 
the prevalence of hiring older versus younger workers.  Preliminary 
results suggest that (1) a small number of occupations hire a 
disproportionate share of older workers, (2) the degree of occupational 
segregation decreases with education and increases with age, so that 
higher-educated workers age 50-54 have the broadest opportunities 
relative to workers age 30-49, while less-educated workers age 60-64 
have the most limited options, and (3) observable differences between 
occupations – including the tasks that occupation’s workers are expected
 to be able to perform – explain only some of the concentration in older
 worker hiring.  These results indicate that older, less-educated 
workers face more substantial barriers to employment, and that policy 
efforts like encouraging retraining and work-sharing arrangements may be
 necessary – but perhaps not sufficient – to improve older job-seekers’ 
employment prospects and help businesses use older workers more 
effectively.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14434_abstract">Marx
 famously proposed the law of the tendency for the rate of profit to 
fall as a result of the capital-intensive bias of capitalist technical 
change.  Empirical studies of long-term movements of the profit rate and
 the output-capital ratio (as a proxy for the inverse of Marx’s organic 
composition of capital) in the leading capitalist economies have found 
little evidence of a definite long-term trend although there has been 
some evidence of falling output-capital ratio and falling profit rate 
during certain historical periods.  This paper proposes a new approach 
to study the movement of the profit rate by considering how the relative
 movement of the growth rate of the capitalist profit and the growth 
rate of capital stock drives both the short-term and the long-term 
profit rate.  Historical evidence from the US and the Chinese economy 
will be used to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in analyzing
 capitalist accumulation and crisis.  Moreover, the approach allows for 
the interaction between different dimensions of the capitalist 
contradictions.  For example, it will be shown that the ecological 
limits to growth may contribute to the validation of Marx’s 19th century
 “law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall” in the context of 
the 21st century.</div>

 paper translates the Marxian macroeconomic model of exploitation of 
labor in my chapter in Kaufman’s forthcoming book from a static context 
to a dynamic one of economic growth. The original assumed that the 
“Keynesian short run”  prevailed, with a given stock of fixed capital 
despite the occurrence of accumulation. This problem cannot be solved by
 neoclassical growth theory (e.g., Solow, 1956) without major 
modification. Crucially, that theory assumes continuous full employment.
 In contrast,  the existence of unemployment requires persistent 
involuntary unemployment in my model. To solve this problem, I use 
Harrod’s Keynesian Essay in Dynamic Theory as a basis for the dynamics 
to my model. However, some neoclassical assumptions are employed: if 
Marxian exploitation can exist despite the assumption of an idealized 
aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function with economies of scale and 
competitive markets shows that the phenomenon can exist even in more 
realistic  circumstances.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14436_abstract">Traditional
 fiscal and monetary policies in the advanced economies and China have 
failed to generate a sustained global recovery since 2009. That failure 
is the result of a growing Systemic Fragility in the global economy, 
which is stunting both multiplier effects and interest rate growth 
elasticities. Systemic Fragility is defined quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and explained as the outcome of the dynamic interaction 
between financial, consumption, and government balance sheet forms of 
fragility. The presentation explains how 9 key global trends have been 
contributing to the growth of Systemic Fragility, and how financial 
asset prices serve as a key transmission mechanism between the fragility
 forms and the 9 key trends. Global shadow banking, the proliferation of
 forms of financial asset, and the expansion of liquid financial markets
 worldwide are offered as the institutional basis for analysis, and the 
rise of a new global finance capital elite, of very- and ultra-high net 
worth professional investors, is offered as the primary agency variable.
 Based on expanded Solow Growth Models, a set of simultaneous equations 
is offered that represent the interaction of the various forms of 
fragility and that, together, the development of Systemic Fragility.</div>

 Great Meltdown happened at a time when most macroeconomists (including 
Nobel Prize winner Bob Lucas as well as none other than the current Fed

that business cycles have vanished for all practical purposes. They were
 obviously dead wrong along with thousands of their colleagues. The 
Queen of England famously asked why those responsible for financial 
stability failed to see such a big bubble coming.   This the talk 
focuses on four aspects of the crisis that are often skirted in 
presentations: 1) the role of ideology in why Greenspan and Bernanke 
overlooked the coming of the crisis; 2) who were the Cassandras whose 
warnings were disregarded; 3) the counterfactual policy that would have 
done a better job of rescuing not only Wall Street but also Main Street

 study examines the economic impact of the duration of occupational 
licensing laws for ten major licensed occupations in the U.S. labor 
market. Time from the passage of occupational licensing laws, which we 
term duration, is important in analyzing occupational licensing because 
states often enact grandfather clauses that protect existing 
practitioners and new workers have higher entry standards than existing 
practitioners, thus increasing the costs to new entrants. This process 
limits the supply of labor and those in the occupation can gain economic
 rents. Using historical data on the year that an occupation was 
licensed by a state and the data available from the American Community 
Survey and the Current Population Survey from 1950-2010, we develop 
estimates of the impact of licensing duration on wages. Our multivariate
 regression estimates combined with non-parametric Kernel estimation 
techniques suggest that it takes at least 10 years to realize the full 
economic wage effects of occupational licensing.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13142_abstract">Occupational
 regulation is a dominant labour market institution affecting many 
workers around the globe. In the US, occupational licensing directly 
affects 29 per cent of workers (Kleiner and Krueger 2013), more than 
those affected by other labour market institutions such as the minimum 
wage or unionization. Similarly, about a third of the UK’s workforce is 
subject to occupational regulation and this figure has been has been 
systematically growing for the past 30 years (Forth et al., 2011). 
However, no comprehensive information exists as to the proportion of the
 EU labour force that is subject to occupational regulation. This paper 
provides the first estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of 
occupational regulation in the EU. We do so by using information from 
the European Commission’s Database of Regulated Occupations and match it
 with data from the 2012 European Labour Force Survey. Our results show 
that between 9 and 24 per cent of EU 27 workers are subject to 
occupational regulation, which is between 19 and 51 million individuals.
 When examining the effects of occupational regulation on mobility, we 
find that the strictness of regulation does not appear to be linked to 
employment-related movement to the UK or else, licensing, compared to 
other forms of regulation, has not deterred entry during this period. 
While only descriptive, this is a clearly encouraging finding for the UK
 labour market. No links were found between the licensing status of an 
occupation and the proportion of EU-migrants within it.</div>

 paper examines a common form of entry restriction: occupational 
licensing. The paper studies two questions: first, how occupational 
licensing laws affect the distribution of quality, and second, how the 
effects of licensing on quality vary across regions of differing income 
levels. The paper uses variation in state licensing requirements for 
teachers and two national datasets on teacher qualifications and student
 outcomes from 1983--2008. Two measures of quality are used: the 
qualifications of candidates entering the occupation (input quality) and
 the quality of service provided (output quality). Results show that 
more restrictive licensing laws---in the form of certification tests 
required for initial licensure---may lead some first-year teachers of 
high input quality to opt out of the occupation. In the sample of 
teachers who remain in the occupation multiple years, stricter licensing
 appears to increase input quality at most quantiles of the teacher 
quality distribution. Output quality, as measured by student test 
scores, also changes with stricter occupational licensing, revealing a 
widening of the distribution. For most forms of licensing studied, input
 and output quality improvements due to stricter licensing requirements 
occur in high-income rather than low-income school districts.</div>

 motor vehicles differ in fuel-efficiency, there is a heterogeneous 
relationship between gasoline prices and new-vehicle demand. Within each
 model-year production cycle, the set of product offerings and prices is
 largely fixed, such that substitution between vehicle models is the 
primary adjustment margin. In this paper, we study firms' production 
decisions in response to demand shocks induced by gasoline prices. Using
 monthly data on plant-level production, inventories, and sales at the

show that firms choose to comply with the regulation by adopting new 
technology. To evaluate the welfare effects of the regulation I estimate
 a structural model using data from before the policy  announcement and 
explicitly test the ability of the model to explain the observed 
responses. I find that, because the abatement is done by technology 
adoption, consumer welfare increases and overall welfare effects depend 
on market failures in the technology market. The design of the 
regulation matters to induce technology adoption.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13017_abstract">Mexico
 City's driving restrictions have now been in place for 25 years, and 
have spurred similar restrictions in Santiago, Sao Paulo, Bogota, 
Medellin, San Jose, Beijing, Tianjin, and Quito. The format differs 
across cities, but most of these programs follow Mexico City's approach 
and restrict driving during weekdays based on the last digit of the 
license plate. The initial rationale for Mexico City’s restrictions was 
to reduce local air pollution, but studies have found little evidence of
 air quality improvements (Davis, 2008, Gallego, Montero, and Salas, 
2013). Drivers do not appear to have switched to the subway or bus 
system. Instead, they used taxis more and bought additional cars so that
 they could drive every day. Despite the lack of empirical support, the 
program was expanded in the summer of 2008 to include Saturdays. Again, 
the primary rationale was air quality, with the Mexico City government 
attempting to address Saturday air pollution levels that had increased 
during the 2000s to reach and often exceed typical weekday levels. This 
paper measures the effect of these new restrictions on air quality using
 high-frequency data from monitoring stations. We compare impacts 
between neighborhoods with different types of traffic patterns and test 
for intertemporal substitution toward Fridays and Sundays.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13018_abstract">It
 has long been argued that increasing the CAFE standards to reduce 
gasoline consumption in automobiles leads to a down-weighting of the 
fleet, increasing accident fatalities. Yet recent studies in the “Arms 
Race” literature point to vehicle weight dispersion, rather than the 
mean weight, as the primary determinant of multi-vehicle accident 
fatalities. This paper is the first to not only measure the effect of 
CAFE standards on weight dispersion across the vehicle fleet, but also 
translate these results into fatalities. We use the recently developed 
recentered influence function (RIF) regression approach for studying 
unconditional quantiles (Firpo et al. 2009), along with comprehensive 
data on vehicle attributes and sales for major manufacturers from 1960 
to 2011. Our estimates suggest that the changes in vehicle weight are 
considerably more complex than a uniform down-weighting. For the 
domestic car fleet we find that CAFE standards resulted in substantial 
down-weighting of vehicles in the 25-50th quantiles, corresponding to a 
roughly 25 to 81 lbs per mpg increase in the lower quantiles. Asian 
manufacturers, with a fuel economy above the standard, show little 
response to standards. They do, however, respond to the stringency on 
the domestic firms suggesting that competition over attributes has the 
possibility to partly mitigate the effect of the standards. Using the 
resulting counterfactual weight dispersion and detailed data on 
police-reported accidents, we find that CAFE standards increased 
fatalities significantly more than previously believed. This finding 
emphasizes the distortions caused by CAFE standards, but may provide 
some support for the new footprint-based standard, which disincentivizes
 reducing vehicle size in the middle and lower end of the weight 
spectrum.</div>

 strengths of Chinese statistics are clear – growing technical capacity 
at NBS and elsewhere; convergence to international norms facilitates 
comparative work; growing availability- albeit sometimes through the 
“back door” – of data that sometimes go beyond what is generally 
available in “transparent” societies – for example I recently attended a
 seminar on R&amp;D issues in which the presenter said that the work is 
hindered by inability to find US data to match the detail available on 
the Chinese side (and this author reads no Chinese!).&lt;br /&gt;

On the pitfalls side, we have&lt;br /&gt;

Some data subject to wide error margins – perhaps most obvious – scale 
and share of farm employment; also provincial and urban population 
totals (do they include migrants?)&lt;br /&gt;

Some data show impossible break points due to improved data collection 
without adjustment of previously reported totals – Carsten has noted 
this for adjustments to GDP data; I’ve noted the same issue in some of 
the transport statistics; I’ve just stumbled across another – the 
reported share of overall outlay on R&amp;D financed by industry jumps 
from 30+% to about 55% between 1999 and 2000 – this obviously did not 
happen but must reflect some sort of updating in which NBS either 
redefines R&amp;D outlay for industry or expands its coverage (see J. of
 South Asian Development 1.1 (2006): 23 by Pranab Bardhan, citing NBS 
Annual Statistics of Science and Technology in China 2006.  In these

 stock measures are derived for China for the years 1952-2013, 
economy-wide and with a sectoral breakdown. The sectoral breakdown 
comprises the three major economic sectors (primary/secondary/tertiary 
sectors), all approximately twenty first-digit sectors, and for the 
years since 1985 all second-digit sectors. The physical capital stock 
measures include productive capital stock (capital services) as well as 
wealth capital stock. Methodological issues raised by the OECD (2009) 
recommendations for calculating capital services are addressed. A great 
number of issues with Chinese data on investment and gross fixed capital
 formation are resolved, ranging from choice of variables to changes in 
the sectoral classification system and the handling of breaks in 
statistical coverage. The consequences of applying methodological 
alternatives to Chinese investment and gross fixed capital formation 
data in constructing capital measures are explored. The resulting 
capital series are contrasted and conclusions are drawn on the most 
appropriate measure of capital services for China for productivity and 
growth analysis. (Depending on progress with the separate construction 
of employment data, my presentation may also include findings on 
productivity developments.)</div>

 purpose of this paper to measure and estimate the distribution of 
personal income and related economic factors in both rural and urban 
areas of the People's Republic of China. Data were collected through a 
series of questionnaire-based interviews conducted in rural and urban

four datasets were derived from the urban questionnaire. The first 
contains data about individuals living in urban areas. The second 
contains data about urban households. The third contains 
individual-level economic variables copied from the initial urban 
interview form. The fourth contains household-level economic variables 
copied from the initial urban interview form. The fifth dataset contains
 village-level data, which was obtained by interviewing village leaders.
 The sixth contains data about individuals living in rural areas. The 
seventh contains data about rural households, as well as most of the 
data from a social network questionnaire which was presented to rural 
households. The eighth contains the rest of the data from the social 
network questionnaire and is specifically about the activities of rural 
school-age children. The ninth dataset contains data about individuals 
who have migrated from rural to urban areas, and the tenth dataset

 article consists of two parts. Part I examines the {\it Chinese Annual 
Survey of Industrial Firms database} (CASIF). We start with a brief 
description of the coverage and key variables, followed by a review of 
recent applications of the data set in empirical studies. We then 
discuss the quality and the limitations of the dataset and propose a 
data cleaning procedure that identifies the key information of each 
firm. In Part II, linking a sub-sample of this micro-level data set with
 two other databases-Chinese Prefecture City and County Fiscal 
Statistical Material and county geographic information, we explore the 
productivity propagation process in space in China's electric apparatus 
industry during 1999-2007. The impacts of firm-specific characteristics 
on productivity growth, the external market conditions and the 
institutional factor are all considered. Within the general nested 
spatial framework, we propose modifications to the 
\citeauthor{Kelejian}'s \citeyearpar{Kelejian} FE-2SLS procedure and the
 \citeauthor{Mutl}'s \citeyearpar{Mutl} RE-FG2SLS procedure to cope with
 the unbalanced panel and find the statistical evidence strongly favors 
the fixed effects over the random effects model. The main results 
indicate (1) there are significantly positive within-region as well as 
between-region productivity spillovers; (2) market competition and 
public expenditure in the local and neighboring districts/counties are 
important sources to boost productivity growth; and (3) the externality 
in productivity growth attenuates in spatial distance.  Notably, the 
between-regional spillover effects are found to be more significant in 
smaller than in larger administrative units and more pronounced in urban
 districts than in counties.</div>

 differences in networking have been cited as one of the main reasons 
for gender earnings and promotion gaps. Despite this fact there is 
little evidence on whether such differences exist and how exactly they 
look like. We conduct an experiment to gain insight into these 
questions. In our experiment participants interact in simulated work 
environments, where promotion and earnings depend on performance, 
networking or designation in different treatments. We do find evidence 
of gender earnings and promotion gaps in treatments where networking is 
important in determining promotion. However, we do not find evidence of 
gender differences in networking. Women and men do not differ in terms 
of their in- or out-degree nor in terms of their centrality in the 
network. Earnings and promotion gaps appear, because there is homophily 
in networks and male, but not female decision-makers, reward their 
network neighbours with increased earnings as well as promotion.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11463_abstract">This
 paper uses a unique database from a French university to analyze gender
 biases in student evaluations of teachers (SETs). The results of 
generalized ordered logit regressions and fixed-effects models suggest 
that male teachers tend to receive higher SET scores because of 
students' gender biases. Male students in particular express a strong 
bias in their favor:  male students are approximately 30% more likely to
 give an excellent overall satisfaction score to male teachers compared 
to female teachers. The different teaching dimensions that students 
value in men and women tend to correspond to gender stereotypes. The 
teaching dimensions for which students perceive a comparative advantage 
for women (such as course preparation and organization) tend to be more 
time-consuming for the teacher, compared to the teaching dimensions that
 students value more in men (such as class leadership skills). Men are 
perceived as being more knowledgeable (male gender stereotype) and 
obtain higher SET scores than women, but students appear to learn as 
much from women as from men, suggesting that female teachers are as 
knowledgeable as men. Finally, I find that if women increased students' 
continuous assessment grades by 7.5% compared to the grades given by 
their male colleagues, they could obtain similar overall satisfaction 
scores as men. Yet, women do not act on this incentive (men and women 
give similar continuous assessment grades), suggesting that female 
teachers are unaware of students' gender biases. These biases have 
strong negative consequences for female academics, who may spend more 
time on teaching to try to obtain high SET scores, reducing time 
available for research. The results suggest that better teaching is not 
necessarily measured by SETs.</div>

 study how psycho-social stress affects willingness to compete and 
performance under tournament incentives across gender. We use a 
laboratory economic experiment in which a task is compensated under both
 tournament and piece-rate schemes and elicit subjects' willingness to 
compete. Stress is exogenously introduced through a modified version of 
the Trier Social Stress Test, and stress response is measured by 
salivary cortisol levels. We find that stress reduces willingness to 
compete. For female subjects, this can be explained by performance: 
while tournament incentives increase output in the control group, women 
in the stress treatment actually perform worse when competition is 
introduced. For males, output is not affected by the stress treatment 
and lower competitiveness seems to be preference-based. These results 
may explain previous findings that men and women react differently to 
tournament incentives in experiments, as well as gender gaps on the 
labor market, since many key career events involve competition in 
stressful settings (e.g. entrance exams or job interviews).</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11902_abstract">Within
 academia, men are tenured at higher rates than women in most 
quantitative fields, including economics. Researchers have attempted to 
identify the source of this disparity but find that 30% of the gap 
remains unexplained even after controlling for family commitments and 
differences in productivity.

I use data from academic economists' CVs to test whether coauthored and 
solo-authored publications matter differently for tenure for men and 
women. While solo-authored papers send a clear signal about one's 
ability, coauthored papers are noisy in that they do not provide 
specific information about each contributor's skills. I find that men 
are tenured at roughly the same rate regardless of whether they coauthor
 or solo-author. Women, however, suffer a significant penalty when they 
coauthor: a woman who coauthors nearly all of her papers has a 40% 
chance of receiving tenure while a man has a 70% chance. A woman who 
solo-authors all of her papers receives tenure at roughly the same rate 
as a man. The results hold after controlling for productivity, research 
quality, field of study, tenure institution, and tenure year. The result
 is most pronounced for women coauthoring with only men and diminishes 
the more women there are on a paper. Furthermore, women are no more 
likely to coauthor with senior economists, suggesting that the results 
are not driven by a simple “seniority” effect. 

I repeat the analysis for sociology and management papers where 
coauthors are listed in order of contribution rather than in 
alphabetical order. The coauthor penalty is significantly diminished 
under these authorship styles.

The paper concludes by proposing a model of statistical discrimination 
in which employers must make promotion decisions based on noisy signals.
 I test the model's predictions and discuss how the model reconciles 
previous discrimination models with trends we see in the data.</div>

 paper combines tax, survey, and national accounts data to build new 
series on the distribution of national income in the United States since

Accounts"  estimates capture 100% of national income recorded in the 
national accounts. This allows us to provide decompositions of growth by
 income groups consistent with total economic growth used in 
macroeconomic analysis. We compute both pre-tax and post-tax per adult 
incomes. We find an overall U-shape for pre-tax top income shares over 
the century 1913-2012, although less marked than the Piketty-Saez 
series. Growth for the bottom 90% incomes has been slower than for upper
 income groups since the 1970s. However, in contrast to survey and 
individual tax data, we find substantial increase in average real

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12391_abstract">In
 this paper we use cross-state panel data to show a positive and 
significant correlation between various measures of innovativeness and 
top income inequality in the United States over the past decades. Yet, 
the correlation between innovativeness and non-top income inequality 
appears to be negative and/or non-significant. Two distinct 
instrumentation strategies suggest that this correlation (partly) 
reflects a causality from innovativeness to top income inequality, and 
the effect is significant: for example, when measured by the number of 
patent per capita, innovativeness accounts on average across US states 
for around 17% of the total increase in the top 1% income share between 
1975 and 2010. Next, we show that the positive effects of innovation on 
the top 1% income share are dampened in states with higher lobbying 
intensity. Finally, from cross-section regressions performed at the CZ 
level, we find that: (i) innovativeness is positively correlated with 
upward social mobility; (ii) the positive coorelation between 
innovativeness and social mobility, is driven mainly by entrant 
innovators and less so by incumbent innovators, and it is dampened in 
states with higher lobbying intensity. Overall, our findings vindicate 
the Schumpeterian view whereby the rise in top income shares is partly 
related to innovation-led growth, where innovation itself fosters social
 mobility at the top through creative destruction.</div>

 developing world is urbanizing at much lower income levels far below 
those that preceded mass urbanization in the West.
Consequently, developing world mega-cities must face the standard 
downsides of density, such contagious disease, congestion and crime, 
with scant resources and often weak governments.    In 19th century 
western cities, the move to clean water and sanitation was aided by 
externality-related rules that penalized unhealthy older technologies, 
like cesspits, and ensured demand for new public or private 
infrastructure.  The poor definition of property rights in the 
developing world makes it particularly difficult to use Pigouvian taxes 
to improve cities, which must instead rely on expensive and often 
wasteful subsidies.   The effectiveness of infrastructure depends on 
institutional strength as well as engineering.  "

 many contexts, different infrastructure technologies are appropriate 
for different scales. For example, national grid electricity has high 
fixed capital costs but low average cost with many users. Household 
solar systems have higher cost per user with many users but may have 
lower cost per user with few users.  The socially optimal technology 
depends on parameter values.  We examine the dynamic problem facing a 
policymaker choosing among technologies, knowing that individuals may 
also install technologies, and argue that there may be multiple 
equilibira, and that policy makers may wish to commit early on a policy.
 The presence of international donors and NGOs may make commitment more 
difficult.  Private agents may strategically delay installing 
infrastructure if they expect outside aid, and if installation of 
infrastructure creates positive externalities (as would arguably be the 
case for some sanitation infrastructure, for example), the anticipation 
of aid may reduce social welfare.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12718_abstract">A
 wealth effect on bequests is the change in bequests in response to an 
exogenous, unanticipated change in wealth.  Normally, a wealth effect 
cannot be observed in household survey data because both wealth and 
bequests result from complicated life-cycle processes.  However, in the 
Great Recession the stock and housing markets declined substantially, 
resulting in sharp, plausibly unanticipated wealth reductions.  We will 
estimate how wealth shocks to financial wealth and housing wealth 
affected expected bequests.  We will use data from the Health and 
Retirement Study on the subjective probability that a bequest will 
exceed thresholds, stated successively as $0, $10,000, $100,000 and 
$500,000.  Using these and population distributions of wealth, we will 
construct expected bequests as stated at time t, and estimate the 
evolution of changes in expected bequests in panel in the panel where t =
 1992, 1994 …2012. We will compare its evolution between 2008 and 2010 
to its evolution over other time periods.  We will estimate a wealth 
effect as the change in expected bequests as a function of changes in 
wealth, where wealth is, successively, housing wealth, financial wealth 
or total wealth, all observed at the household level in panel, taking 
account of household modifiers such as the number of (adult) children 
and macro modifiers such as the local unemployment rate.  Taking active 
saving to be small compared with unanticipated changes in wealth permits
 OLS estimation, but we will also use IV estimation to control for any 
active saving.  For example, because of differences in the timing of HRS
 interviews, households have different exposures to stock market price 
changes, permitting us to use stock price changes as an instrumental 
variable.  Our results will show how a wealth shock is expected to be 
divided between bequests and future consumption.</div>

 data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we make two 
contributions to the literature on end-of-life transfers. First, we show
 that unequal bequests are much more common than generally recognized, 
with one-third of parents with wills planning to divide their estates 
unequally among their children. These plans for unequal division are 
particularly concentrated in complex families, which are of two types: 
families with stepchildren and families with genetic children with whom 
the parent has had no contact, e.g., children from previous marriages. 
We find that in complex families past and current contact between 
parents and children reduces or eliminates unequal bequests. Second, 
although the literature focuses on the bequest intentions of parents who
 have made wills, we find that many older Americans have not made wills.
 Although the probability of having a will increases with age, 30 
percent of HRS respondents aged 70 and over have no wills. Of HRS 
respondents who died between 1995 and 2010, 38 percent died without 
wills. Thus, focusing exclusively on the bequest intentions of parents 
who have made wills may provide an incomplete and misleading picture of 
end-of-life transfers.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12721_abstract">The
 need for long-term care (LTC) is a significant risk for ageing 
populations. The risk is individual because of the emotional, physical 
and economic consequences of care needs. LTC provision systems vary 
across countries. In Europe health insurance covers health related 
expenses, but expenses related to care and accommodation costs in 
nursing homes are less uniformly covered by private or public 
insurances. Cost is not the only preoccupation: the quality and type of 
care provider are equally important.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who need care get it through a combination of informal care, 
mostly provided by family members, and formal care, partially of totally
 covered by public or private insurance systems. Depending on the level 
of needs, the care arrangements can leave some “unmet needs “and provide
 more or less incentives for the children to step in and help.&lt;br 
/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relying on 5 waves of data from the SHARE survey on health and 
retirement in Europe we define gradual levels of needs of LTC based on 
the respondents’ number of limitations in activities of daily living 
(ADL) and in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We then 
document the type of help received. Comparing level of needs and care 
received, we derive whether the needs are adequately met. Information on
 out of pocket expenses will also be taken into account.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forms of care and “unmet needs” will then be related to the respondents’
 characteristics and the national LTC systems. Wealth level, hence 
prospective bequests, past intergenerational transfers and exchanges, 
living arrangements, will help disentangle the family motivations and 
relating them to the national welfare policy context.&lt;br /&gt;</div>

 workers applying more to high-wage jobs? While search directed to jobs 
offering higher wages in the theoretical literature has strong 
implications for labor market efficiency, the evidence supporting this 
sort of behavior is scarce and murky. In this paper, we first provide 
strong evidence of directed search in online job markets. Since most 
jobs do not post an explicit wage, selection bias is a potential threat 
to identification. Indeed, we show that job adds that post a wage 
explicitly require significantly lower education and experience. We 
surmount this critical empirical problem by using wages that employers 
expect to pay, which is available in our data, even if they choose not 
to make it visible for applicants. When wages are not explicitly 
declared, we still find a less intense but highly significant directed 
search evidence, suggesting that the text and requirements of the posted
 job add tacitly convey wages. While this evidence suggests a prevalent 
directed search behavior, standard theories of this sort cannot fit all 
the stylized facts we uncover. We advance a theoretical model of noisy 
wage posting that rationalizes both strategic wage posting, and directed
 search behavior intensity as qualitatively observed in the data.</div>

 paper applies (and extends) Choo and Siow's (2006) empirical approach 
to estimating matching games with transferrable utility to determine the
 degree to which local labor markets have become more geographically 
integrated in the fifteen year period (1996-2010) corresponding to the 
rise of the internet.  The matching framework can isolate changes in 
structural factors  (relative tastes, costs, or productivities 
associated with particular types of matches/transitions) from changes in
 matching patterns (geographic job-to-job transition patterns) that are 
simply driven by the evolving composition of types on both sides of the 
labor market.  Exploiting the LEHD database, our results reveal a 
consistent and sizable trend away from job-to-job transitions featuring a
 short distance (1-10 miles) between origin and destination employers 
and a corresponding trend toward transitions featuring moderate distance
 (25-100 miles).  These results suggest that integration of local labor 
markets has primarily occurred at a sub-state and perhaps even 
sub-county level of geographic aggregation, which has prevented previous
 inter-state and inter-county analyses of job and residential mobility 
from detecting the trend.  Finally, we show how the matching framework 
can be used to produce counterfactual simulations illustrating how the 
geographic incidence of local labor demand shocks is likely to have

 paper complements a small but growing literature on the effect of 
corporate taxes on R&amp;D investment and patent holdings. We provide 
evidence that patenting strategies are exploited as a device to transfer
 income to low-tax jurisdictions. Using data on the population of 
corporate patent applications to the European Patent Office, we show 
that the location of R&amp;D investment and patent ownership is 
geographically separated in a non-negligible number of cases. Moreover, 
our results suggest that this geographical split is partly motivated by 
tax considerations. We find that countries which levy low patent income 
taxes attract ownership of foreign-invented patents, especially those 
patents that have a high earnings potential. Analogously, inventor 
countries with high patent income tax rates observe ownership 
relocations of high-quality patents from their borders. Moreover, our 
results suggest that the probability for a patent to be owned by a party
 in a tax haven country significantly decreases if the inventor country 
has implemented controlled foreign company laws.</div>

 paper uses quasi-experimental variation stemming from two major income 
and wealth tax changes in the Swiss canton of Obwalden in the past 
decade. The canton introduced a regressive tax scheme with the explicit 
purpose of attracting affluent taxpayers, followed by a change to a flat
 rate tax a few years later due to a federal court ruling. Using 
individual tax register data form the cantonal tax administration, I try
 to answer the question of how responsive migration is to income and 
capital tax reductions at the top, and whether these pull effects are 
different for a reduction in income or wealth taxes, respectively. First
 results suggest that the responses in terms of inflows have been of an 
immediate but short-term nature. Average and median income and wealth of
 those who moved-in immediately after the introduction of the regressive
 tax are higher than than before and after and average income and wealth
 of the in-movers in this period were also higher than those of the 
residents. This immediate response is in line with the theory and other 
findings on tax responses, for example, in the elasticity of taxable 
income (ETI) literature.</div>

 last several decades have witnessed a rapid development of Emergency 
Medical Services (EMS) across our nation as an increasingly important de
 facto link in integrated health care delivery. However, this system of 
prehospital care is often fragmented and highly inconsistent across 
geographic regions. Using ambulance dispatch, clinical outcome, billing,
 and personnel data on 15.1 million ambulance runs in a large ambulance 
chain, we evaluate variation in productivity across ambulance sites and 
personnel. The data include detailed information on time spent at the 
scene of emergency, travel times, and travel distance. We find 
significant differences in productivity within sites across workers, and
 that these differences are highly correlated across roles in ambulance

 has been widely noted that areas in the United States with higher 
levels of per capita Medicare utilization do not tend to have better 
patient outcomes. We explore whether individuals who move to areas with 
higher per capita utilization experience better outcomes than those who 
move from the same area to places with lower per capita utilization. 
Controlling for where one starts and other baseline characteristics, we 
find a statistically significant negative relationship between the 
utilization in one's destination area and post-move mortality. 
Interestingly, the reverse does not appear to hold; individuals who move

benefit. Incentives for firms to provide low prices and high quality are generated by consumers
who choose among multiple insurance plans in each market. To date the literature has primarily
focused on consumers, and has calculated how much could be saved if they chose better plans. In
this paper we take the next analytical step and consider how plans will adjust prices as consumer
search behavior improves. We use detailed data on enrollees in New Jersey to demonstrate
that consumers switch plans infrequently and imperfectly. We estimate a model of consumer
plan choice with inattentive consumers. We then turn to the supply side and examine insurer
responses to this behavior. We show that high premiums are consistent with insurers profiting
from consumer inertia. We use the demand model and a model of firm pricing to calculate how
much lower Part D program costs would be if consumer inattention were removed and plans
re-priced in response. Our estimates indicate that consumers would save $601 each over three
years when firms’ choice of markup is taken into account. Cost growth would also fall: by the
last year of our sample government savings would amount to $224 million per year or 4.1% of
the cost of subsidizing the relevant enrollees.</div>

 years ago, the field of Economics included an active research agenda 
attempting to determine the productivity impact of information 
technology. The paradox, often attributed to Bob Solow, was that 
businesses were investing heavily in IT and yet economists could not 
find measurable productivity improvements from those investments. The 
same phenomenon is occurring in the United States today with healthcare 
IT spending. The paper traces the parallels between the two cases with 
available data. Research shows that the effect of IT on output is 
impacted by the organizational characteristics of the investing firm. 
The paper argues that this mechanism will be important for healthcare IT
 investments as well.</div>

Using newly available data on fertility preferences and outcomes, we

 then build a bargaining model of fertility choice and match the model

Previous theoretical work has mostly focused on limited commitment as 
the friction causing the lack of insurance. Recent evidence from field 
experiments with married couples in developing countries points to the 
importance of asymmetric information. In this paper we introduce private
 information in models of household decision-making and explore its 
implications for risk-sharing. Different from standard private

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12974_abstract">Traditional
 cultural practices can play an important role in development, but can 
also inspire condemnation. The custom of bride price, prevalent 
throughout sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia as a payment of the 
groom to the family of the bride, is one example. In this paper, we show
 a surprising economic consequence of this practice. We revisit one of 
the best-studied historical development projects, the INPRES school 
construction program in Indonesia, and show that previously found small 
effects on female enrollment mask heterogeneity by bride price 
tradition. Ethnic groups that traditionally engage in bride price 
payments at marriage increased female enrollment in response to the 
program. Within these ethnic groups, higher female education at marriage
 is associated with a higher bride price payment received, providing a 
greater incentive for parents to invest in girls' education and take 
advantage of the increased supply of schools. For those girls belonging 
to ethnic groups that do not practice bride price, we see no increase in
 education following school construction. We replicate these same 
findings in Zambia, where we exploit a similar school expansion program 
that took place in the early 2000s. While there may be significant 
downsides to a bride price tradition, our results suggest that any 
change to this cultural custom should likely be considered alongside 
additional policies to promote female education.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13475_abstract">The
 pace of business dynamism as measured by indicators such as job 
reallocation has declined in the U.S. in recent decades. Part of the 
explanation is a decline in entrepreneurship and the share of activity 
accounted for by young firms. In this paper, we explore whether the 
decline in these various patterns of business dynamism can be accounted 
for by a decline in the variance of idiosyncratic shocks impacting firms
 or by a decline in the responsiveness of firms to the shocks. Using 
plant-level data from the U.S. manufacturing sector, we find that there 
is a rising dispersion in idiosyncratic TFP shocks across plants in the 
same industry. Canonical models of firm dynamics imply that the rising 
dispersion in idiosyncratic shocks should be accompanied by a rise in 
the pace of reallocation instead of a decline. Instead, we find that the
 marginal effects of idiosyncratic plant-level productivity shocks on 
growth and survival have declined over time. We find that this decline 
in marginal response is especially for young firms. Our analysis 
explores these issues across different sectors that have different 
patterns of decline in the pace of reallocation over time. For example, 
the high tech sectors within manufacturing exhibited a rising pace of 
reallocation through 2000 and then it has fallen sharply since then. We 
find that there is rising dispersion in idiosyncratic TFP shocks in this
 sector in the post 2000 period but a declining responsiveness to those 
shocks. The decline in responsiveness is especially for young firms. In 
future drafts of this paper, we plan to extend this analysis to 
investigate the changing pattern of productivity shocks and the 
responsiveness to shocks in all sectors of the U.S. economy.</div>

 most previous recessions, the 2007-2009 contraction was associated with
 a very large and persistent decline in new business formation. We study
 the aggregate implications of this phenomenon. While reduced entry rate
 plays only a minor role in accounting for the initial contraction, the 
effects are very persistent under plausible models of firm dynamics. 
This suggests that lower entry may account for part of the slow U.S. 
recovery. We start with a simple calculation that illustrates that lower
 entry since 2006 “accounts” for a significant reduction of employment. 
We next present state-level and MSA-level evidence within the U.S. in 
order to evaluate this hypothesis. We consider several alternative 
factors that may affect the speed of the recovery such as the debt to 
GDP ratio, the decline in house prices, or the decline in small business
 lending. Among the considered hypothesis the decline in entry stands 
out as the dominant factor in predicting the speed of the recovery.</div>

 empirical work has shown that new business formation has declined 
substantially over the past three decades, while firm growth and 
survival rates conditional on firm age have remained relatively stable. 
This paper studies the causes of declining firm entry. First, by 
exploiting cross-state variation in OLS and IV settings, we establish 
that declines in the growth rate of the working age population over this
 period can explain more than half of the decline. We then study a 
simple model of firm dynamics and show that it can generate a similar 
response of firm entry to labor supply shifts. When calibrated to the 
1980s, the model can explain most of the decline in firm entry, while 
being consistent with the stability of survival and growth rates over 
time. Our findings suggest that the decline in the growth rate of the 
working age population and its general equilibrium effect on labor 
demand drives the bulk of the decline in firm entry.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13160_abstract">We
 present an extrapolative model of bubbles. In the model, many investors
 form their demand for a risky asset by weighing two signals---an 
average of the asset's past price changes and the asset's degree of 
overvaluation. The two signals are in conflict, and investors “waver” 
over time in the relative weight they put on them. The model predicts 
that good news about fundamentals can trigger large price bubbles. We 
analyze the patterns of cash-flow news that generate the largest 
bubbles, the reasons why bubbles collapse, and the frequency with which 
they occur. The model also predicts that bubbles will be accompanied by 
high trading volume, and that volume increases with past asset returns. 
We present empirical evidence that bears on some of the model's 
distinctive predictions.</div>

ownership contracts with maturities often exceeding 700 years. Freeholds
 are infinite maturity ownership contracts. The price difference between
 leaseholds with extremely long maturities and freeholds reflects the

thus a direct empirical measure of the transversality condition. We

 We show that conventional dynamic term structure models (DTSMs) 
estimated on recent U.S.~data severely violate the zero lower bound 
(ZLB) on nominal interest rates and deliver poor forecasts of future 
short rates. In contrast, shadow-rate DTSMs account for the ZLB by 
construction, capture the resulting distributional asymmetry of future 
short rates, and achieve good forecast performance. These models provide
 more accurate estimates of the most likely path for future monetary 
policy---including the timing of policy liftoff from the ZLB and the 
pace of subsequent policy tightening.  We also demonstrate the benefits 
of including macroeconomic factors in a shadow-rate DTSM when yields are
 constrained near the ZLB.</div>

 argue that central bank large-scale asset purchases - commonly known as
 quantitative easing (QE) - can reduce priced frictions to trading 
through a liquidity channel that operates by changing the shape of the 
price distribution of the targeted securities. For evidence we analyze 
how the Federal Reserve's second QE program that included purchases of 
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) affected a measure of 
liquidity premiums in TIPS yields and inflation swap rates. We find 
that, for the duration of the program, the liquidity premium measure 
averaged 12 to 14 basis points lower than expected. This suggests that 
QE can improve market liquidity.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13552_abstract">We
 find that investors’ expectations of U.S. nominal yields, at different 
maturities and forecast horizons, exhibit significant time-variation 
during the Great Moderation. Nominal zero-coupon bond yields for the 
U.S. are used to fit the yield curve using a latent factor model. In the
 benchmark model, the VAR process used to characterize the conditional 
forecasts of yields has constant coefficients. The alternative class of 
models assume that investors use adaptive learning, in the form of a 
constant gain algorithm and an endogenous gain algorithm, which we 
propose here. Our results indicate that incorporating time-varying 
coefficients in the conditional forecasts of yields lead to large 
improvements in forecasting performance, at different maturities and 
horizons. These improvements are even more substantial during the Great 
Recession. We conclude that our results provide strong empirical 
motivation to use the class of adaptive learning models considered here,
 for modeling potential investor expectation formation in periods of low
 and high volatility, and the endogenous learning model leads to 
significant improvements over the benchmark in periods of high 
volatility. A policy experiment, which simulates a surprise shock to the
 level of the yield curve, illustrates that the conditional forecasts of
 yields implied by the learning models do significantly better at 
capturing the response observed in the realized yield curve, relative to
 the constant-coefficients model. Furthermore, the endogenous learning 
algorithm does well at matching the time-series patterns observed in 
expected excess returns implied by the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters.</div>

 use the term structure of disagreement of professional forecasters to 
document a novel set of facts: (1) forecasters disagree at all horizons,
 including the long run; (2) the term structure of disagreement differs 
markedly across variables: it is downward sloping for real output 
growth, relatively flat for inflation, and upward sloping for the 
federal funds rate; (3) disagreement is time-varying at all horizons, 
including the long run. These new facts present a challenge to benchmark
 models of expectation formation based on informational  frictions. We 
show that these models require two additional ingredients to match the 
entire term structure of disagreement: First, agents must disentangle 
low-frequency shifts in the fundamentals of the economy from short-term 
fluctuations. Second, agents must take into account the dynamic 
interactions between variables when forming forecasts. While models 
enriched with these features capture the observed term structure of 
disagreement irrespective of the source of the  informational friction, 
they fall short at explaining the time variance of disagreement at 
medium-and long-term horizons. We also use the term structure of 
disagreement to analyze the monetary policy rule perceived by 
professional forecasters and show that it features a high degree of 
interest-rate smoothing and time variation in the intercept.</div>

 Penn-Balassa-Samuelson effect is the stylized fact about the positive 
correlation between cross-country price level and per-capita income. 
This paper provides evidence that the price-income relation is actually 
non-linear and turns negative in low income countries. The result is 
robust along both cross-section and panel dimensions. Additional 
robustness checks show that biases in PPP estimation and measurement 
error in low-income countries do not drive the result. The different 
stage of development between countries can explain this new finding. The
 paper shows that a model linking the price level to the process of 
structural transformation captures the non-monotonic pattern of the

 data for over hundred years and 14 countries is used to estimate the 
long-run effect of productivity on the real exchange rate. We find large

 model is not consistent with these results, we suggest an explanation 
of the results in terms of contemporary variants of the model that 
incorporate the terms of trade mechanism. Specifically we argue that 
changes in trade costs over time may affect the impact of productivity 
on the real exchange rate over time. We undertake simulations of the

country’s price level and the tradable sector’s share of employment is 
much more robust. Finally, we extend our theoretical analysis into a 
dynamic trade model with unbalanced trade to quantitatively examine how 
structural changes and policy distortions may have influenced the 
dynamics of the China-US real exchange rate. We show that much of the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11282_abstract">In
 this work, I examine the impact of state-level policies on the demise 
of Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs) and the subsequent increase in the 
use of Refund Anticipation Checks (RACs). Both are products offered by 
tax-preparers that provide taxpayers with an earlier refund (in the case
 of a RAL) or a temporary bank account from which tax preparation fees 
can be deducted (in the case of a RAC). Each product is costly compared 
with the value of the refund, and they are often marketed to low-income 
taxpayers who may be liquidity constrained or unbanked. States have 
responded to the predatory nature of RALs through regulation, leading to
 a switch to RACs. Using zip-code-level tax data, I examine the effects 
of various state-level policies on RAL activity and the transition of 
tax-preparers to RACs. I then examine the effect this transition had on 
taxpayer outcomes, measured at the county level using Current Population
 Survey data. I find that state regulation regarding disclosure led to a
 swifter withdrawal of tax preparers from RAL provision, but the decline
 in provision was largest for the few states with interest-rate caps. 
While the drop in RAL provision led to a decrease in the number of 
taxpayers receiving an EITC in the zip code, the average size of the 
credit was unaffected. I discuss the implications of the findings on the
 necessity of states to adapt as new lending strategies emerge.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10796_abstract">International
 tax fraud has become a major source of discontent for fiscal 
authorities worldwide. Legal provisions for voluntary disclosures that 
lead to tax amenity constitute one tool to combat such fraud. In 
Germany, voluntary disclosures have risen significantly over the last 
few years, as state tax authorities, in particular from North 
Rhine-Westphalia, have repeatedly bought data CDs with names of 
potential tax evaders and their foreign accounts. Purchases of such data
 CDs by tax authorities increase the risk of detection for tax evaders 
and may spur timely voluntary disclosures of tax evaders for fear of 
facing criminal charges. This paper presents first evidence on the 
effect that data purchases have on voluntary disclosures. In our 
analysis, we use a self-compiled data set that comprises monthly 
self-declared tax frauds by citizens in North Rhine-Westphalia that are 
related to Swiss Banks as well as information on the timing and content 
of several data CD purchases from 2010 to early 2015. Our results show 
that these exogenous shocks to the probability of detection had a 
positive and sizeable effect on the evolution of voluntary disclosures. 
Various robustness checks corroborate this conclusion.</div>

 paper examines the effect of Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate changes on tax 
evasion in an environment of limited tax-shifting opportunities. I focus
 on the recent VAT rate reduction in the Greek restaurant industry 
(August 2013) and implement a difference-in-difference methodology using
 large fast-food restaurants as the control sample, due to the fact that
 they exhibit high constraints on underreporting. I find that the 
reduction of the VAT rate for non-alcoholic sales from 23% to 13% 
increases the reported sales to inputs ratio, which is used as a measure
 of disclosure of hidden sales, by 11.8% on average. The effect is more 
pronounced in small firms and firms with less alcoholic sales. This 
result is consistent with VAT ratio targeting, the partial adjustment of
 VAT revenues to the lower tax rate, in order to maintain a reasonable 
VAT ratio (revenues to credits) and to avoid signaling evading behavior 
to tax authorities. I also document the reverse effect for the VAT rate 
increase in September 2011. Finally, I show that, accounting for the 
partial downward adjustment of VAT revenues and the higher direct taxes 
from the increase in reported sales, the overall fiscal cost from the 
rate reduction becomes minimal.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13687_abstract">The
 global financial crisis and the ensuing criticism of macroeconomics 
have inspired researchers to explore new modeling approaches. There are 
many new models that aim to better integrate the financial sector in 
business cycle analysis and deliver improved estimates of the 
transmission of monetary policy. In order to design effective policies 
policy making institutions need to compare available models of policy 
transmission and evaluate the impact and interaction of policy 
instruments. This paper proposes a framework for comparative analysis of
 macro-financial models and presents new tools and applications. It 
builds on and extends recent work on model comparison in the area of 
monetary and fiscal policy. The computational implementation enables 
individual researchers to conduct systematic model comparisons and 
policy evaluations easily and at low cost. It also contributes to 
improving reproducibility of computational research in macroeconomic 
modeling. An application presents comparative results concerning the 
dynamics and policy implications of different macro-financial models. 
These models account for financial accelerator effects in investment 
financing, credit and house price booms and a role for bank capital. 
Monetary policy rules are found to have an important influence on the 
comparisons. Finally, an example concerning the impact of leaning 
against credit growth in monetary policy is discussed.</div>

collaboratively working on data and sharing data is not very common, 
yet. This is also reflected in the professions’ journals, where policies
 on data management and data sharing currently exist for a small 
minority of journals only.
Our talk gives an overview on data policies of journals in economics and
 business studies. In the course suggests guidelines for data policies 
aiming to foster replication of published research and presents some 
characteristics of journals equipped with such data policies. Also the 
status quo in disseminating underlying research data of empirically 
based articles will be presented.
Against this analytical background the talk identifies some challenges 
associated with the current e-infrastructure for providing 
publication-related research data by journals. The presentation also of 
the EDaWaX project, a project funded by the German Research Foundation 
(DFG), the data policies in a sample of 346 journals have been analyzed.
 The talk analyses how these policies are structured and what 
requirements authors have to fulfill to satisfy the policies’ requests. 
Besides, the presentations suggests software components to solve some of
 these challenges.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13689_abstract">Although
 much work remains to be done, the last decade or so has witnessed 
substantial improvements in the standards for documenting empirical 
research achieved by the economics profession. Much of this progress can
 be attributed to the many initiatives that have been undertaken for the
 purpose of enhancing replicability. In this paper, we argue that, 
thanks to these improvements, the printed (or pdf) article is becoming 
obsolete as the primary medium for communicating empirical research, and
 should be replaced by the “research compendium,” which includes the 
article in its traditional form, but also includes documentation 
containing all the information necessary to replicate the results 
reported in the article. The two components of the research 
compendium—the article and the documentation—should be of equal status: 
authors should take as much care in preparing transparent and persuasive
 documentation as they do composing the article; and for someone 
interested in learning about the research, opening up the documentation 
and running the code should be considered just as essential as reading 
the paper itself. The idea that research compendia, containing the 
research article as well as complete replication documentation, should 
replace the article by itself as the medium for communicating research 
has been proposed in the computational and experimental natural 
sciences; we argue that the idea is equally applicable for empirical 
social science research.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13690_abstract">In
 empirical economics, a twofold lack of incentives leads to chronic 
problems with replicability: For authors of empirical studies providing 
replicable material is not awarded in the same way as publishing new 
irreplicable studies is. Neither is authoring replication studies.
We set incentives for replicability and replication.
First, we gave replication seminars at several faculties 
internationally. Integrating replication in the education of young 
scholars raises the awareness for the importance of replicability among 
the next generation of researchers and ensures that a big number of 
scientists get incentives to write replication studies: credit points 
and the prospect of publications at least of working papers already 
during their time as students.
Second, our wiki (http://replication.uni-goettingen.de) documents the 
results of published replications. It includes a database of more than 
2000 studies. A substantial expansion to include all studies in journals
 with replication archives is in progress. For each study we provide 
information about the availability of material for replication. This 
helps to identify practical examples for courses focusing on empirical 
methods or on particular topics. We provide an overview of journals and 
their policies regarding data availability and publication of 
replications.
Everyone can participate; even undergraduates can make their 
contribution: Everyone can find errors in Excel files, and everyone can 
confirm that some research is documented so well that one can follow 
each step and with one click reproduce all quantitative results. We have
 identified two frequent problems: Usually not all published results can
 be obtained from the replication material provided. Information about 
how the used data were obtained from the raw data is rarely sufficient.
We provide information about existing projects that facilitate the 
sharing of material for empirical econometric research and we invite for
 discussion to develop standards for how to make research replicable and
 how to write replication studies.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13640_abstract">The
 rising price of college is seen as a major barrier to building the 
stock of college-educated labor. While most Federal and state policy 
efforts focus on reducing college costs, declining state funding of 
public institutions has also led to sharp cuts in per-student spending. 
When resources are scarce, how should public colleges balance tuition 
increases with spending cuts? In this paper, we study changes in price 
and spending in U.S. higher education markets from 1990 to the present 
using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 
(IPEDS). Our empirical strategy exploits local variation in state budget
 shocks combined with state-level legislative tuition caps to jointly 
estimate the impact of changes in price and spending on student 
enrollment and degree completion. We find that enrollment and completion
 in nonselective public institutions is much more responsive to 
increases in spending than to revenue-neutral reductions in price. 
Applying our parameter estimates to a structural model of college 
choice, we estimate that a 100 percent reduction in the price of 
community college yields an enrollment gain that could be obtained at 
about 25 percent of the total cost of “free” college, if the funds were 
used instead to increase spending.</div>

 (1973) noted that individuals' choice of educational quantity—measured 
by years of schooling—may stem partially from a desire to signal their 
ability to the labor market. This paper asks if individuals' choice of 
educational quality—measured by school reputation—may likewise signal 
their ability. We analyze the college market in the country of Colombia,
 and define a measure of college reputation that gives clear predictions
 under the benchmark signaling model for years of schooling. We find 
that college reputation is correlated not just with graduates' initial 
earnings but also with their earnings growth. We also show that 
Colombia's staggered rollout of a new signal of skill—a college exit 
exam—lowered the earnings return to reputation. These results suggest 
that the sorting that takes place by educational quality differs from 
that which happens by quantity, but that college reputation does 
partially perform a signaling function.</div>

 explore whether initial college choice affects low-skilled students’ 
degree completion rates. Admission to Georgia’s public universities 
requires minimum SAT scores. Regression discontinuity estimates show 
that access to such universities increases four-year college enrollment 
and the quality of college chosen. Most importantly, access to public 
universities substantially increases bachelor’s degree completion rates.
 SAT retaking behavior suggests students value access to this sector. 
Our degree completion results may partly explain the labor market return
 to college quality. Proposals to make community college free could 
lower degree completion rates if quality reforms do not accompany price

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_10240_abstract">Rigidity
 in wages has long been thought to impede the functioning of labor 
markets.  One recent strand of the research on wage flexibility in the 
United States and elsewhere has focused on the possibility of asymmetric
 rigidities in the nominal wage-setting process—most notably the 
downward nominal wage rigidity posited by Keynes (1936) and, later, 
Tobin (1972) —and what implications such rigidity might have for the 
macroeconomy at low levels of inflation.  The Great Recession of 
2008-09, during which the unemployment rate topped 10 percent and price 
deflation was at times seen as a distinct possibility, has added to the 
relevance of this line of inquiry.   In this paper, we use 
establishment-level data from a nationally representative 
establishment-based compensation survey collected by the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics (BLS) to investigate the extent to which downward nominal 
wage rigidity is present in U.S. labor markets.   We use a number of 
distinct methods proposed in the literature to test for downward nominal
 wage rigidity, and whether such rigidity is more severe at low rates of
 inflation and in the presence of negative economic shocks than in more 
normal economic times.  Like earlier studies, we find evidence of a 
significant amount of downward nominal wage rigidity in the United 
States.  We find mixed evidence on how downward nominal wage rigidity 
has changed over time, but no evidence of a decline in rigidity during 
the Great Recession.</div>

short-run Phillips curve. Comparing simulation results from the model 
with data on U.S. wage patterns, we show that downward nominal wage

unemployment and wage growth during the last three recessions and

 administrative worker-firm linked data from the Longitudinal Employer 
Household Dynamics (LEHD) program of the U.S. Census Bureau, we document
 that wages of workers remaining with the same firm exhibit substantial 
flexibility. While the distribution of average nominal hourly wage 
changes is asymmetric, with a spike at zero and missing mass to the left
 of zero, only about 13 percent of workers experience no change in their
 nominal hourly wage within a year; and over 20 percent of workers 
experience a reduction in their nominal hourly wage. Moreover, firms 
systematically achieve reductions in labor costs by decreasing hours 
worked rather than cutting hourly wages. As a result, the distribution 
of changes in nominal earnings is less asymmetric, with only about 6 
percent of workers experiencing no change in nominal annual earnings, 
and over 25 percent of workers experiencing a reduction in nominal 
annual earnings. During the recent Great Recession, this earnings change
 distribution becomes almost completely symmetric and the proportion of 
workers experiencing decreases in annual earnings rises markedly to 
about 40 percent. The distribution of earnings changes also varies 
substantially across firms, with large firms and contracting firms 
exhibiting few of the characteristics typically associated with downward
 wage rigidity.</div>

 paper tests for downward nominal wage rigidity by examining transitory 
shifts in labor demand, generated by rainfall shocks, in 600 Indian 
districts from 1956-2009.  Three facts are consistent with nominally 
rigid wages. First, there is asymmetric adjustment: nominal wages rise 
in response to positive shocks but do not fall during droughts. Second, 
after transitory positive shocks have dissipated, nominal wages do not 
adjust back down, generating ratcheting.  Third, inflation moderates 
these effects, enabling downward real wage adjustments both during 
droughts and after positive shocks.  Rigid wages generate employment 
distortions, creating boom and bust cycles: employment is 9% lower in 
the year after a transitory positive shock than if the positive shock 
had not occurred. These results are not consistent with other 
transmission mechanisms, such as migration or capital accumulation. 
These findings indicate the presence of rigidities in markets for casual
 daily agricultural labor―a setting with few institutional constraints. 
 Survey evidence suggests that workers and employers believe that 
nominal wage cuts are unfair and lead to effort reductions.</div>

 paper analyzes a growth firm's trade-off between hoarding cash to 
reduce dilution associated with external financing and delaying

firms with better investment opportunities hoard less and use more 
external financing, leading them to quicker success and to potentially 
becoming cash-rich as they mature. Several novel insights emerge in such
 a setting: Taking into account self-selection, firms that stay private 
hoard and delay investment less than when they go public. Furthermore, 
contrary to common beliefs, competition can cause longer delays and more
 hoarding, while asymmetric information leads growth firms to reduce 
hoarding.</div>

 investigate how market participants price and manage counterparty risk 
in the post-crisis period using confidential trade repository data on 
credit default swap (CDS) transactions. We find no evidence that 
counterparty risk affects the pricing of CDS contracts, but strong 
evidence that counterparty risk is managed via the choice of 
counterparties. We show that market participants are significantly less 
likely to trade with counterparties whose credit risk is highly 
correlated with the credit risk of the reference entities and with 
counterparties whose credit quality is relatively low. Furthermore, we 
examine the impact of mandated central clearing on CDS pricing and 
counterparty choices. In contrast to the previous literature, we find 
that transaction spreads on centrally cleared trades are significantly 
lower relative to spreads on contemporaneous uncleared transactions. We 
also find that the counterparty choice of uncleared trades is more 
sensitive to the credit quality of the dealer than the counterparty 
choice of bilateral trades that are soon thereafter centrally cleared.</div>

 argue that Credit Default Swap (CDS) premia for safe-haven

are driven to a large extent by regulatory requirements under which  
derivatives dealing banks have an  incentive to buy CDS to hedge 
counterparty credit risk of their  counterparties.
We explain the mechanics of the regulatory requirements and develop a 
model in which derivatives dealers, who have a derivatives exposure with
 sovereigns, need CDS for capital relief. End users without exposure to 
the sovereigns sell the CDS and require a positive premium equivalent to
 the capital requirement. The model's predictions are confirmed using 
data on several sovereigns.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21522_abstract">We
 examine the sensitivity of dollar-denominated emerging market corporate
 bond prices to currency risk.  Investors in international markets 
overwhelmingly demand that emerging market corporate issuers float debt 
in major currencies; over 85% of emerging market debt is denominated in 
developed market currencies.  Investors cite insurance against foreign 
exchange risk as the rationale for demanding developed market currency 
debt.  However, in doing so, these investors may overlook the influence 
of foreign exchange risk on the probability that emerging market 
corporations will default on their debt due to a currency mismatch 
between revenues and liability payments.  We find in our sample that on 
average 35% of hazard rate variability can be attributed to changes in 
exchange rate volatility.  We propose a model incorporating currency 
risk in spreads and find significant impacts on spread sensitivity to 
foreign exchange risk and material impacts on prices of default risk.  
Our results suggest that investors in dollar-denominated emerging market
 bonds are substituting currency risk for default risk.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21013_abstract">We
 adapt structural models of default risk to take into account the 
special nature of bank assets. The usual assumption of log-normally 
distributed asset values is not appropriate for banks. Bank assets are 
risky debt claims, which implies that they embed a short put option on 
the borrowers' assets, leading to a concave payoff. This has important 
consequences for banks' risk dynamics and distance to default 
estimation. Due to the payoff non-linearity, bank asset volatility rises
 following negative shocks to asset values. As a result, standard 
structural models in which the asset volatility is assumed to be 
constant can severely understate banks' default risk in good times when 
asset values are high. Bank equity payoffs resemble a mezzanine claim 
rather than a call option. Bank equity return volatility is therefore 
much more sensitive to negative shocks to asset values than in standard 
structural models. </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21267_abstract">We
 argue exogenous random treatment is insufficient for valid inference 
regarding the sign and magnitude of causal effects in dynamic 
environments. In such settings, treatment responses must be understood 
as contingent upon the typically unmodeled policy generating process. 
With binary assignment, this results in quantitatively significant 
attenuation bias. With more than two policy states, treatment responses 
can be biased downward, upward, or have the wrong sign. Further, it is 
not only generally invalid to extrapolate elasticities across policy 
processes, as argued by Lucas (1976), but also to extrapolate within the
 same policy process. We derive auxiliary assumptions beyond exogeneity 
for valid inference in dynamic settings. If all possible policy 
transitions are rare events, treatment responses approximate causal 
effects. However, reliance on rare events is overly-restrictive as the 
necessary and sufficient conditions for equality of treatment responses 
and causal effects is that policy variable changes have mean zero. If 
these conditions are not met, we show how treatment responses can 
nevertheless be corrected and mapped back to causal effects or 
extrapolated to forecast responses to future policy changes.</div>

the business cycle whereas small firms' financing policy is pro-cyclical for debt and
equity. This paper proposes a mechanism that explains these cyclical patterns. Small
firms grow faster and need therefore more funds compared to large rms. During times
with high aggregate productivity, they quickly exhaust their endogenous debt limit and
must turn to equity financing. In contrast, large firms are close to their efficient scale
and want to payout to shareholders. Good times lower the probability of default, de-
creasing the costs of debt financing for large firms so that debt is used to payout to
shareholders. We embed this mechanism in a quantitative firm industry model with
endogeneous firm dynamics and explore how macroeconomic shocks get amplified.</div>

 incorporate  managerial career concerns as in Holmstrom (1999) into a

she attempts to influence the market's belief of her talent. However, in
 equilibrium, career concerns cause the self-interested manager to work 
hard especially when she is more productive creating substantial value 
for shareholders even beyond the first-best MM benchmark value (for a 
firm that is wholly owned by a risk-neutral manager without career 
concerns.) Additionally, financial constraints and managerial career 
concerns jointly have important conceptual and quantitative effects on 
corporate investment, financing, and valuation.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21176_abstract">We
 study sequential investment decisions in the venture capital (VC) 
industry. VC-backed companies typically need to raise several rounds of 
funding from VC funds. The decision whether to provide further funding 
to the company and the terms of the new funding determine the returns of
 VC funds and their ability to back successful companies. We show that 
investment outcomes in the VC industry can be predicted by whether the 
existing VC investors can attract new outside investors to participate 
in the next round. Inside rounds, in which only existing investors 
participate, lead to a higher likelihood of failure, lower probability 
of IPOs, and lower cash on cash multiples than outside rounds. Inside 
rounds, in which the value of the company declines since the previous 
funding, are particularly worse. We explore two mechanisms that explain 
these stylized facts: the escalation of commitment that leads VC 
investors to irrationally make negative NPV decisions, and agency costs 
between VC funds and their investors that make VC investors gamble with 
their investors’ money.</div>

 recent rise of crowdfunding begs the question of what unique value the 
crowd brings to entrepreneurs compared with sophisticated 
intermediaries. This paper proposes an answer to this question by 
focusing on the informational role of crowdfunding. I argue that a 
distinct role of crowdfunding is the provision of early feedback to 
entrepreneurs that facilitates their learning. Using a large dataset 
from Kickstarter, I first document that entrepreneurs adjust their 
expectations about their projects based on feedback from the crowd, and 
that such adjustments are stronger when entrepreneurs face higher 
uncertainty or when the crowd is more experienced. The crowd’s feedback 
affects entrepreneurs’ subsequent continuation decisions and project 
choices, and influences the aggregate entry pattern of future 
entrepreneurs on the platform. I then establish the learning advantage 
of crowdfunding leveraging the entry decisions of heterogeneous 
entrepreneurs. I show that, when crowdfunding becomes more costly 
relative to alternative financing (bank borrowing), entrepreneurs 
choosing crowdfunding shift to those that benefit particularly from 
early feedback, i.e., those facing high uncertainty or high fixed costs.
 These results suggest that crowdfunding is not merely a financing tool,
 but also a learning device that improves the information environment 
faced by entrepreneurs.</div>

 this paper we investigate whether a new form of market for early stage 
venture financing – crowdfunding – reduces the barriers of female 
entrepreneurs to raise pre-seed capital. Specifically, we investigate 
gender dynamics and biases in the process of raising funding to new 
projects via the leading crowdfunding platform - Kickstarter.  We find 
women made up about 35% of the project leaders and 44% of the investors 
on the platform.  On average, men seek significantly higher levels of 
capital than women for their projects, and also raise more funds than 
women. However, women enjoy higher rates of success in funding their 
projects, even after controlling for category and goal amount.  Only 
about 23% of projects that men invested in had female project leads. 
Conversely, more than 40% of projects that women invested in had female 
project leads. Multivariate analysis indicated significant positive 
correlation between the gender of the project leader and the percentage 
of the same gender investors. Questions arise around what factors 
explain the fact that female-led projects are predominantly financed by 
women. In an attempt to disentangle taste-based discrimination from 
statistical discrimination we conducted a survey of investors from the 
Kickstarter platform and find evidence that some of lower investment in 
female-led projects by men can be attributed to taste-based 
discrimination.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20398_abstract">We
 document that since 1994 the US equity premium follows an alternating 
weekly pattern measured in FOMC cycle time, i.e. in time since the last 
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The equity premium is earned 
entirely in weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 in FOMC cycle time (with week 0 starting
 the day before a scheduled FOMC announcement day). We show that this 
pattern is likely to reflect a risk premium for news (about monetary 
policy or the macro economy) coming from the Federal Reserve: (1) The 
FOMC calendar is quite irregular and changes across sub-periods over 
which our finding is robust. (2) Even weeks in FOMC cycle time do not 
line up with other macro releases. (3) Volatility in the fed funds 
futures market and the federal funds market (but not to the same extent 
in other markets) peaks during even weeks in FOMC cycle time. (4) 
Information processing/decision making within the Fed tends to happen 
bi-weekly in FOMC cycle time: Before 1994, when changes to the Fed funds
 target in between meetings were common, they disproportionately took 
place during even weeks in FOMC cycle time. In addition, after 2001 
Board of Governors discount rate meetings (at which the board aggregates
 policy requests from regional federal reserve banks and receives staff 
briefings) tend to take place bi-weekly in FOMC cycle time. As for how 
the information gets from the Federal Reserve to the market, we rule out
 the Federal Reserve signaling policy via open market operations 
post-1994. Furthermore, the high return weeks do not systematically line
 up with official information releases from the Federal Reserve or with 
the frequency of speeches by Fed officials. We end with a discussion of 
quiet policy communications and unintended information flows.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21474_abstract">We use a new data set obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request to investigate the
trading strategies of the employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We find
that a hedge portfolio that goes long on SEC employees’ buys and short on SEC employees’
sells, covering 7,197 trades, over the years 2009-2011, earns positive and economically
significant abnormal returns of (i) about 4% per year for all securities in general; and (ii) about
8.5% in U.S. common stocks in particular. The abnormal returns stem not from the buys but
from the sale of stock ahead of a decline in stock prices.
There are three potential explanations for these returns: (i) luck; (ii) skill of the traders; and (iii)
access to non-public information. We cannot rule out the role of luck given the limited time
period studied but if skills explained these results, we would expect to observe abnormal returns
on both buys and sells. We find a few trades where employees divest (i) in the run-up to six SEC
enforcement actions; and (ii) after whistle blowing tips alleging financial misconduct are filed by
employees with OSHA against their employers. The SEC has responded that each of these
trades was approved and that staff assigned to an inquiry is asked to sell its holdings in the
targeted firm as a matter of policy. Because such inquiries are (i) not publicly announced in a
timely manner; and (ii) can cause stock prices to fall when known to the market, we are not sure
whether this policy is reasonable. We also wonder why the SEC’s employees are even allowed
to hold individual stocks.</div>

 in the taxation of asset returns can create ownership clienteles. Using
 a simple model, we demonstrate that an important consequence of 
tax-policy-induced ownership segmentation is to limit risk-sharing, 
creating regions of the aggregate demand curve for the asset that are 
"downward-sloping." As a result, the constraints of the ownership 
clientele impact the asset price response to variations in asset supply 
and demand, and make the asset's price more sensitive to movements in 
idiosyncratic risk. We test these predictions on U.S. municipal bonds, 
where cross-state variation in state tax privilege policies results in 
different levels of home-state-biased ownership of local municipal 
bonds. In states with high tax-induced ownership segmentation, we find 
greater susceptibility of municipal bond yields to demand and supply 
variation, heightened sensitivity of muni yields to local political 
uncertainty, and greater difficulties in raising capital for public 
projects.</div>

 develop a model of capital reallocation to analyze whether the presence
 of more arbitrageurs improves capital allocation and welfare. While 
trades can become crowded due to imperfect information and 
externalities, arbitrageurs can devote resources to flexibly learn about
 the number of earlier entrants. Above a threshold, increasing the 
number of arbitrageurs does not affect capital allocation: whether there
 is eventually too little or too much capital allocated to the trade  is
 solely determined by the parameters of the market. The flexibility in 
the learning technology is key to this insight. However, the presence of
 more arbitrageurs decreases welfare, as they use more aggregate

 estimate a realistic process for noise trading to help theorists 
calibrate their models. For this purpose we characterize the trades 
executed by individual investors, who are natural candidates for the 
role of noise traders because their trades are (on average) 
cross-correlated, loss making, and weakly correlated with stocks’ future
 fundamentals. We use transactions data from a retail brokerage house 
and small TAQ trades, obtaining consistent results. We find that noise 
trading can be treated as i.i.d. normal at the monthly frequency, which 
conforms with theorists’ assumptions. Weekly trades follow (as widely 
assumed) an AR(1) process, but their residuals are not normal. Daily 
trades require multiple lags and have nonnormal residuals. We provide a 
complete description of these processes, including estimates of their 
standard deviation (a.k.a. noise trader risk). In line with theory, our 
estimates of noise trader risk are higher for stocks that are more 
liquid and more volatile.</div>

assets which are traded in segmented markets.  We emphasize the role of

in becoming an expert in the market for the risky asset, and entrants 
subsequently vary in their level of expertise.   We show how parameters

attention and consumer investment behavior. Our ﬁndings indicate a 31 percent local
average increase in quarterly capital ﬂows into mutual funds mentioned in a prominent
Wall Street Journal “Category Kings” ranking list, compared to those funds which just
missed making the list. This ﬂow increase is about 7 times larger than extra ﬂows due
to the well documented performance-ﬂow relation. Other funds in the same complex
receive substantial extra ﬂows as well, especially in smaller complexes. We show mutual
fund managers react to the incentive created by the media effect in a strategic way
predicted by theory, and present evidence for the existence of propagation mechanisms
including increased fund complex advertising subsequent to having a Category King
and increased efficacy of subsequent fund media mentions.</div>

 is common for mutual fund managers to concurrently manage assets on 
behalf of clients outside the mutual fund industry.  If these other 
accounts are more lucrative in terms of current or potential manager 
compensation, this provides an incentive for managers to favor these 
other accounts at the expense of mutual fund investors.  Using a new 
dataset hand collected from mandatory SEC filings and therefore free of 
selection bias, we examine the performance of funds with managers who 
receive performance-based incentive fees in three different types of 
accounts: registered investment companies, pooled investment vehicles, 
and separately managed accounts.  We find that only funds with managers 
who receive incentive fees in pooled investment vehicles (e.g., hedge 
funds) underperform other peer funds by an economically and 
statistically significant 9.6 bps per month in Carhart alpha, or 1.15% 
per year.  Further tests using a sample of mutual fund managers who 
begin to manage a hedge fund during the sample period confirm our prior 
finding of the negative impact on mutual fund performance.  Our evidence
 provides support for the conflicts of interest hypothesis in the debate
 on “side-by-side management” of mutual funds and hedge funds. </div>

 paper develops an empirical model of dynamic interactions within an 
employment network, and applies it to the real estate market in a large

framework because agents must team together in order to produce. 
Repeated interactions increase human capital by facilitating future 
production. Entry by agents into the network, their turnover within it, 
along with their quitting from the network, endogenously determines the 
creation, growth, decline and disappearance of the establishments that 
employ them. We analyze an employment network with two sectors, a 
loosely organized nonprofit sector, and a for-profit one. Our empirical 
analysis estimates the importance of networking in the real estate 
industry, and evaluates how efficiently the network functions.</div>

more slowly than comparable entrants with higher commissions. Properties
 listed with lower commission rates experience less favorable 
transaction outcomes: they are 5% less likely to sell and take 12% 
longer to sell.   These adverse outcomes reflect decreased willingness 
of buyers' agents to intermediate low commission properties (steering) 
rather than heterogeneous seller preferences or reduced effort of 
listing agents. While all brokerage agencies prefer properties with high

paid by individuals, but pay higher prices than investors. In addition, 
consistent with prior literature, we find that owner agents sell houses 
they own at higher prices.</div>

 analyse the equity Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, whose 
structural idiosyncrasies exemplify shortcomings of received theory to 
comprehensively explain capital structure outcomes at the industry 
level. A customised theory of REIT capital structure is outlined that 
highlights liquidity management in total leverage and secured v. 
unsecured debt choices. Empirical testing shows that firm value is 
highly sensitive to capital structuring decisions. Starting from a high 
base level of leverage, a statistically robust and economically 
significant negative relationship between leverage and firm value is 
documented. We also find that the use of unsecured debt, which commits 
management to the preservation of debt capacity, generally has a 
positive effect on firm value. Our work further highlights the effects 
of taxes at the individual level, a muted pecking order, and an inverted
 free cash flow effect.</div>

 paper constructs a model of mortgage delinquency which tests the extent
 to which commercial mortgage borrowers anticipate a loan modification 
resulting from such a delinquency. Using a sample of modified loans from
 commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issued between January 
2000 and January 2014, we estimate the present value of modified cash 
flows. In order to project these benefits at any possible time of 
modification for a delinquent loan, we take the difference between the 
present value of modified cash flows and the face value of debt as a 
measure of the net benefit as well as simultaneously estimate property 
values to control for the borrower's current equity position. The 
resulting net benefits are then weighted by each loan's estimated 
survival probability up to the time of modification under consideration,
 so that the resulting discounted sum covering the potential time in 
delinquency serves as a proxy for a borrower's anticipation of the 
benefits of such a modification, assessed at any possible time of 
delinquency. Our results show that a borrower's anticipation of a 
modification event increases the delinquency hazard, and are supportive 
of the notion that borrower delinquency is strategically endogenous.</div>

significantly: specifically, we estimate that the expected value of a

 efficiency of price discovery in the REIT market is an issue of 
enduring interest. Unfortunately, existing studies focus on REIT index 
data, and the general equity efficiency literature that uses individual 
assets typically excludes this sector. Our first contribution is a 
comprehensive assessment of the pricing efficiency of the U.S. REIT 
market that uses every listed REIT trading over the 1993-2011 period. 
Our variance ratio analysis finds that the typical REIT is efficient 
throughout our sample period. We show that the distribution of 
REIT-level variance ratios exhibits excess kurtosis, implying a 
non-trivial mass of inefficiently-priced REITs. Our second contribution 
is to document that the relatively inefficiently-priced REITs tend to 
become relatively more efficient over time, consistent with the actions 
of arbitrageurs. We explore the importance of informed trading, cash 
flow variability, and market frictions measures in explaining the 
cross-sectional dynamics of informational efficiency. Our third 
contribution is methodological: we show that quantile regression methods
 help to isolate the impact of arbitrageurs since they are more likely 
to affect the pricing efficiency of REITs in the extreme quantiles of 
the efficiency distribution.</div>

 paper studies the impact of democratic and autocratic transitions on 
governance outcomes in a panel of 39 developing countries over the 
period 1984-2010, using an event study method. We find that democratic 
transitions are on average followed by an improvement in governance 
after six years, while a short-lived deterioration of governance can on 
average be observed approximately around six or seven years after 
autocratic transitions. Moreover, the bulk of the improvement of 
institutional outcomes following a democratic transition is due to a 
lasting improvement in government stability and a temporary reduction of
 the role of the military in politics. We find some evidence that 
democratic transitions reduce the likelihood of external conflicts, and 
that autocratic transitions decrease the likelihood of internal 
conflicts.&lt;br /&gt;
We find that some institutional outcomes, such as corruption or ethnic 
conflict do not react in a statistically significant way after 
transitions, suggesting that their roots are deeper than the others. We 
also report evidence that the impact on institutional outcomes of 
democratic transitions is conditional on ethnic fractionalization, 
openness, and education.</div>

 democracy causes economic growth has been a matter of theoretical and 
empirical debate. Recent studies show that democracy has a positive 
effect on growth. We argue that looking at the average effect of 
democracy on long run growth ignores the heterogeneity of growth 
experiences among authoritarian regimes relative to democratic regimes. 
Also, the emphasis on long-run growth contradicts the stylized facts of 
economic growth in developing countries characterized by frequent shifts
 in growth regimes from stagnant or declining growth to accelerations in
 growth and back again. We examine the political determinants of the 
magnitude of growth in acceleration and deceleration episodes. We first 
obtain 322 growth episodes for 125 countries from 1950 to 2010 combining
 statistical and filter based approaches to identifying growth breaks. 
We then propose a method to calculate the magnitude of growth in such 
episodes. Next, we show that authoritarian regimes have different 
features of growth episodes as compared to democracies, with both 
strongly positive and strongly negative growth episodes. We then 
disaggregate authoritarian regimes by type of regime and show that 
single party-based authoritarian regimes outperform democracies in 
growth accelerations, but that there is no difference between 
democracies and personalist, military based and monarchic authoritarian 
regimes in their effects on growth. On the other hand, non party based 
autocracies are likely to have larger growth decelerations than 
democracies and party based autocracies. These results suggest that in a
 growth episode framework, the effect of the political regime on growth 
is asymmetric across accelerations and decelerations and that 
democracies do not necessarily outperform autocracies in a growth 
acceleration episode, though they are likely to prevent large growth 
collapses. We also highlight the importance of the type of autocracy in 
understanding the effects of regime type on growth.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13927_abstract">Why
 do some dictators institutionalize their ruling parties after coming 
into power, whereas others do not? Ruling parties in autocracies are an 
important channel through which dictators can solve a multitude of 
governance problems, such as resolving distributional conflicts or 
co-optation of elites. However, autocratic parties vary a great deal in 
their levels of institutionalization, defined as the extent to which 
party organizations operate independent of particular leaders. I argue 
that dictators institutionalize their ruling parties by taking actions 
that limit personal authority, such as setting term limits or creating 
procedures for party officials to move up the hierarchy. However, party 
institutionalization involves tradeoffs: although it deters other party 
elites from staging coups against the regime, it also shifts power away 
from the dictator. I formalize these tradeoffs in a game theoretic model
 in which party institutionalization is a mechanism by which the 
dictator voluntarily binds his hands. In particular, the dictator can 
choose whether to offer patronage or permanent giveaways to a group of 
party elites. In the model, patronage is a temporary offer that can 
fluctuate over time, depending on the distribution of power between the 
dictator and party elites. Permanent giveaways, by contrast, represent 
party institutionalization and constitute a guaranteed division of 
benefits that cannot be undone. I find that dictators who are either 
very weak or very strong at the start of the regime will be the least 
likely to institutionalize. I corroborate these theoretical arguments 
with original data on portfolio allocations and constitutional term 
limits in African one-party regimes from 1960-2005 and find that 
patterns of patronage and permanent giveaways closely follow the 
predictions of the model.</div>

quality. Compiling a new panel data set that encompasses 60 years of 
environmental and public health outcomes for 130 countries, we utilize 
fixed-effects and GMM methods to understand the channels in which 
economic freedom can lead to a cleaner and healthier environment. Our 
results show that economic freedom manifests itself in better

correlates with poorer political institutions in general, leading to 
worse environmental and public health outcomes. These results are robust
 to different control sets and all econometric specifications.</div>

 effect of familiarity has been used to explain why individuals prefer 
to invest in stocks that are geographically close. This has to do with 
feelings of belonging, not with an information. Familiarity creates 
positive affect, which in its turn leads to lower estimated risk and 
higher expected return. Against this background and combining behavioral
 economics with cognitive linguistics we study whether the language used
 in investor communication may create feelings of familiarity or 
distance depending on whether the receiver is a man or a woman. If so, 
this might contribute to explaing the gender gap in stock market 
participation. Studying Dutch, English and Italian websites addressing 
potential retail investors, we find that the metaphors used come from 
identical domains, and our further analysis reveals that these domains 
refer to worlds that are stereotypically masculine including war, heavy 
physical activity and competitive play. We argue that this may result in
 feelings of belonging (in the metaphorical sense) among men, not women.
 If this would affect attitudes and risk estimates, it would bias men 
toward risk taking, and women toward avoiding risky assets. This would 
contribute to explaining the gender gap in stock market participation 
and financial risk taking.</div>

 marriage remains highly prevalent in many countries, especially for 
girls. The practice is driven in part by cultural traditions, but it is 
also often a financial and economic transaction conducted by the parents
 of the girl who marries early. While the practice may have in some 
cases short term benefits for households (and possibly even in extreme 
cases for the girls marrying early), it has a range of large long-term 
negative impacts for the girls, their children, and their communities. 
This paper provides a synthesis of the results obtained in the first

marriage. Overall estimates of the cost of the practice globally are 
provided on the basis of an assessment of the impact of the practice in 
the areas of education, labor force participation, empowerment, health,

supply for married women based on this estimate is around -0.06. In 
contrast, the receipt of the EITC does not affect the timing of the 
labor supply of married men and single women. The subgroup analysis 
suggests families might reduce the labor supply of secondary earners in 
response to receiving an anticipated EITC payment. In addition, My 
results suggest that the presence of liquidity constraints and myopia 
could be important reasons for my findings.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14280_abstract">Education
 is an indicator of development but education also enables development. 
Women’s education in particular has substantial market and non-market 
returns, contributing positively to women, their families, communities, 
and nations. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Constitution of India (1951) guarantees universal education for all 
children under the age of fourteen years. The 86th Amendment to the 
Indian constitution (2002) made education for ages 6-14 years free, 
compulsory, and a fundamental right. Yet universal education still 
eludes India. A particularly troubling aspect of the problem is a strong
 socio-cultural bias exists against girls’ education. According to 
National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS- 2005-2006), in 2005, only 
76% of girls ages 6-14 years were attending school, an unacceptably low 
observed percentage compared to the planned 100% universal schooling.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important problem also is that schooling deprivation and child work 
are often simultaneously occurring economic phenomena. The girl child in
 particular is vulnerable to economic exploitation. According to the 
NFHS, in 2005, 11% of girls ages 12-14 did more than 28 hours of 
household chores per week, compared to 3.5% of boys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this backdrop, the overarching objective of this paper is to draw 
upon economic theory and the empirical datasets to explore causes and 
consequences of the unschooled girl child worker in India. Drawing upon 
economic theories of intra-household resource allocation, investment in 
human capital, capabilities theory, and the Mincer function together 
with arguments on deep-seated cultural prejudice against girls’ 
education in India, this paper will present the economic, financial with
 cultural issues driving millions of unschooled girl child workers. It 
will then discuss micro and macro level consequences of depriving the 
girl child of her human right to education and freedom from economic 
exploitation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14393_abstract">Dams
 are an important part of climate change adaptation plans in many 
countries; global reservoir capacity will increase between 2010 and 2050
 by 2800-­‐3000 km3, at an annual average net cost of about $12 billion 
(Ward et al., 2010). The economics literature offers little evidence of 
dams’ impact on drought vulnerability, however, and no description of 
the full spatial distribution of these impacts globally. Without this 
information, it is difficult to say whether these investments will 
result in net economic benefits. By smoothing the variability of water 
supply, dams may help countries adapt to changes in the frequency and 
severity of droughts and floods. But dams may also increase 
vulnerability to drought; for example, irrigators may respond to dams by
 planting more water-­‐intensive crops (similar to the effect 
demonstrated for groundwater access by Hornbeck and Keskin (2014)), and 
industry and households may install more water-­‐intensive technologies.
 Alternatively, the net effect on drought vulnerability may be positive 
in a dam’s command area, but negative further downstream, if upstream 
dams reduce river flows.

This paper econometrically estimates the impacts of drought on economic 
activity – measured using the nighttime lights index (Chen and Nordhaus,
 2011; Henderson et al., 2012) – and the mediating influence of dams, 
which may either mitigate or exacerbate drought impacts, depending on 
location and behavioral responses. Previous studies have examined these 
questions focusing on agricultural impacts in a region of the United 
States (Hansen et al., 2011), but our work examines a wider range of 
economic activity and countries, and separates effects near the dam from
 those in downstream areas. To address concerns about endogeneity in dam
 location, we plan to use an instrumental variable approach (Duflo and 
Pande 2007). Preliminary results, without addressing potential 
endogeneity, suggest that dams may exacerbate the harms from both 
drought and very wet years.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14394_abstract">Economists
 are increasingly interested in the effect of climate change (See, for 
example, Deschenes&lt;br /&gt;
and Greenstone, 2011 and Aroonruengsawat and Auffhammer, 2011). This 
literature, however, has &lt;br /&gt;
focused almost exclusively on the extent to which changes in temperature
 will influence electricity &lt;br /&gt;
demand. Climate change will not just affect temperature, but will result
 in more frequent and more &lt;br /&gt;
severe droughts (See Dai, 2011). Because water consumption varies 
between power plants, increased &lt;br /&gt;
drought will lead to substitution from high-water-intensity sources of 
electricity generation to &lt;br /&gt;
low- water-intensity options. If water-intensive, carbon-clean sources 
are displaced by &lt;br /&gt;
less-water-intensive, but more carbon-intensive generation sources, 
greenhouse gas emissions will &lt;br /&gt;
rise as a result of increased water scarcity. This can be viewed as the 
supply-side corollary to the                    
temperature-induced,demand-side effect of climate change on energy 
systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This paper uses a fixed-effect panel data model of electricity 
generation at the plant-level, and&lt;br /&gt;
explicitly accounts for the spatial correlation in generation decisions.
 We find that hydroelectric &lt;br /&gt;
generation decreases substantially in response to drought, though this 
baseline generation is &lt;br /&gt;
offset by coal, natural gas, and other renewables depending on the 
geographic region. Results &lt;br /&gt;
broadly suggest that increases in water scarcity between 2001 and 2012 
shifted the generation &lt;br /&gt;
portfolio towards fossil fuels in many energy markets and we provide 
empirical evidence that &lt;br /&gt;
droughts increased emissions of carbon as well as local pollutants. We 
estimate the social costs of &lt;br /&gt;
water scarcity to be $10 million per month for a drought-ridden state 
attributable to carbon &lt;br /&gt;
emissions alone. Finally, we find that water scarcity results in 
increased generation from plants &lt;br /&gt;
that rely on municipal water sources, indicating that in times of water 
scarcity, the electricity &lt;br /&gt;
sector will compound pressure on government water supplies.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14395_abstract">There is now a substantial body of evidence that high temperature shocks lead to reduced
economic productivity (both agricultural and non-agricultural), conflict, and mortality in 
developing countries. A separate strand of literature has shown that adverse circumstances around 
the time of birth (including drought and environmental disaster) have significant consequences for 
welfare later in life. Taken together, these two findings suggest that higher temperatures at the 
time of birth may have long-term productivity consequences. However, despite the obvious importance 
to climate change impacts, we are not aware of studies that have investigated this link.
In this paper, we investigate the effect of temperature shocks around the time of birth on formal 
earnings as an adult. To do so, we match and regress the 2010 earnings of all formal sector workers 
in Ecuador (over 1.5 million individuals born between 1945 and 1989) on temperature and rainfall 
shocks in and around the year of each individual’s birth, at the location of birth. To the best of 
our knowledge, our analysis is the first to relate administrative income data to year of birth 
circumstances. We find that higher temperatures while an individual is in-utero lead to 
significantly lower earnings, especially for women, for whom a 1°C increase in temperature leads to 
a 1.1%-1.7% decrease in earnings. In contrast, temperature in the first 9 months after birth has no 
effect on future earnings. Our results are robust to the inclusion of localized annual cycles and 
time trends, and to falsification tests that randomly shuffle weather realizations
between years and locations.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14396_abstract">Many
 studies have estimated the impact of climate on agriculture by 
regressing land value per hectare on average temperature and 
precipitations, controlling for other confounding effects.1,2 However, 
there is reasonable concern that models that use only average conditions
 may not reveal potentially large and negative effects of extreme 
temperatures and precipitations. Several studies have used the whole 
distribution of temperature and flexible functional forms to capture 
potential threshold effects of very high and very cold temperatures.3 
This method is attractive but suffers from one problem: the extreme 
temperatures and precipitations are usually recorded during distinct, 
rare climatic events. For example, the very high temperatures are 
usually recorded during heat waves. 
Extreme low precipitations are recorded during droughts. These extreme 
events are complex climatological phenomena that are associated with a 
range of anomalous weather conditions. They also occur in specific 
geographic areas. Models that do not identify the connection between 
extreme observations of temperature (precipitation) and extreme 
climatological events may suffer from omitted variable bias.4 
Preliminary cross-sectional regressions in which we control for very 
high temperatures (e.g. above 36 °C) reveal that the extreme 
temperatures are very harmful for agriculture. However, models that also
 control for the frequency of heat waves indicate that the high 
temperatures alone do not have any significant effect while having 
frequent heat waves is significantly harmful. This is particularly 
important when one tries to estimate the impact of future climate 
change. Future impacts depend on the frequency and intensity    of these
 extreme, complex climatological events. We estimate the frequency with 
which heat waves, cold waves, droughts, tornadoes and storms are 
observed in all US counties and we estimate how they affect land values.
 Our preliminary results suggest that extreme events significantly 
affect land values in the US.</div>

 study the causal effect of labor unions on corporate payout policy by 
using a regression discontinuity (RD) design. Passing a union election 
leads to an 8.7% lower dividend ratio and a 17.9% lower total payout 
ratio (including both dividends and share repurchases) than failing an 
election in the following year. The negative effect of unions on payout 
is absent in firms located in states with right-to-work laws but without
 work stoppage provisions. Operating flexibility appears to be a 
plausible underlying mechanism through which union power influences 
corporate payout, and firms use the saved earnings from reductions in 
payout to invest in net working capital rather than paying off debt or 
increasing cash holdings. Our paper sheds new light on the determinants 
of firm payout policy and the role of labor unions in corporate finance 
decisions. </div>

 paper reexamines the tradeoff between signaling commitment and 
maintaining timing and abandonment options in payout decisions in the 
context of a new form of payout: SEC Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans, which
 require firms to pre-commit. Relative to open market repurchases, these
 preset plans provide an expanded available repurchase window and 
increase legal cover, albeit at the cost of forfeiting repurchase 
flexibility and the option to time repurchases. Firms with greater 
internal capital reserves or easier access to external capital are more 
likely to pre-commit to a repurchase plan, as are firms with a history 
of poor repurchase timing and firms constrained by blackout windows. 
Using the 2008-2009 financial crisis as a positive exogenous shock to 
the marginal benefit of financial flexibility, we further find that the 
growth in preset repurchase programs significantly stagnated during the 
crisis. Consistent with preset plans sending a signal of commitment, 
establishing a 10b5-1 plan to execute an existing repurchase—without 
increasing the authorized repurchase amount—is associated with positive 
abnormal returns of 1.1%. We find weak evidence of firms using preset 
repurchases to substitute for dividends; rather, preset plans are 
generally associated with a one percentage point increase in repurchase 
yield.</div>

 paper describes the results of a randomized control trial that 
introduced mobile money in rural areas of Mozambique for the first time.
 For this purpose we benefit from the fact that mobile money was only 
recently launched in the country, allowing for the construction of a 
pure control group. This paper reports on the results obtained over the 
two years after the randomized introduction of mobile money in 102 
villages in the southern provinces of the country.  Our analysis makes 
use of administrative data from the mobile money provider, as well as 
behavioral and survey data. We measure impact on take-up, savings and 
remittances, as well as individual and community level consumption and 
investment patterns. Initial take-up was sizeable, at 64% of treated 
individuals, and there were interesting dynamics of adoption over time. 
We observe a tendency for mobile money to substitute traditional 
alternatives for both savings and remittances, and evidence of an 
increase in the willingness to remit due to the availability of mobile 
money.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21833_abstract">This
 paper focuses on a recent example of institutional innovation in 
informal finance in the Philippines: the emerging credit arrangement 
called ‘ATM sangla (pawning).’ We report on the analysis of a small 
survey of 320 factory workers in an industrial estate near the Metro 
Manila area. ATM sangla is informal loan arrangement where the 
borrower’s ATM card is used as the collateral and where the lender uses 
the ATM card to withhold the repayment (principal and interest) from 
salary payment on every pay day until the entire amount is repaid. 
Slightly less than half of our respondents (42%) actually utilized ATM 
sangla at least once, and the average amount of the loan (principal) is 
15,000 pesos, which correspond to 1.3 times the average monthly salary. 
We find that roughly one third of our respondents are hyperbolic 
discounters, who tend to hold higher loan balances with ATM sangla 
transactions than the time-consistent discounters. We find evidence that
 those hyperbolic discounters are naïve, rather than sophisticated, 
suggesting that the emergence of ATM sangla may have encouraged them to 
overborrow.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21834_abstract">While
 private equity (PE) is expanding rapidly in developing countries, there
 is little academic research on this subject. In this paper I exploit 
two new data sources and employ two distinct empirical strategies to 
identify the impact of PE on Indian firms. I compare the investments 
made by one of India's largest PE firms to the investments that just 
missed (deals that made it to the final round of internal 
consideration). I also combine four large PE databases with accounting 
data on 34,000 public and private firms and identify effects using 
differences in the timing of investments. I find three results 
consistently in both databases. First, larger, more successful firms are
 more likely to receive PE investment. Second, firms that receive 
investment are more likely to survive and also have greater increases in
 revenues, assets, employee compensation, and profits. Third, somewhat 
surprisingly, these firms' productivity and return on assets do not 
improve after investment. This is consistent with PE channeling funding 
to high productivity firms rather than turning around low productivity 
firms. PE, at least in India, appears to alleviate expansion constraints
 and improve aggregate productivity through reducing misallocation 
rather than by increasing within-firm TFP.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21835_abstract">Survey
 data on clients of CFPAM, the leading microlender in China, indicate 
that nearly 70% of all surveyed joint-liability borrower groups are 
"bogus" -- that is, one person uses all loans given to group members in a
 single investment project while all other group members act as 
unproductive cosigners. This practice not only violates CFPAM rules but 
is also inconsistent with the majority of the theoretical literature on 
group lending, a basic tenet of which is that each borrower uses their 
own loan to implement their own investment project (what we call 
`standard group'). We therefore extend the classic model of group 
lending under joint liability by explicitly allowing for both standard 
and bogus groups in a setting with the possibility of strategic default 
due to limited enforcement. The optimal choice between standard and 
bogus groups is endogenous and depends on the borrowers' characteristics
 (project productivity and probability of success). We analyze the 
optimal group loan contract (or menu of contracts) and show that bogus 
groups optimally arise when either the productivity differential between
 the projects in a group is high (in heterogeneous groups), or when the 
absolute level of project productivity is high (in homogeneous groups). 
Explicitly allowing for the possibility of bogus group formation not 
only helps the lender avoid losses which may occur if bogus groups are 
ignored, but also enhances the productive efficiency and borrower 
welfare in the economy. We test the model predictions with data from 
rural China and evaluate the welfare gains from implementing the optimal
 contract (or menu) relative to the benchmarks of: (a) lenders operating
 unaware of bogus groups or (b) lenders using a contract with terms that
 endogenously rule out bogus group formation.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21867_abstract">Monetary
 policy measures taken by the Federal Reserve as a response to the 
2007-09 financial crisis and subsequent economic aftermath led to an 
extremely large increase in the level of outstanding reserves. The 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control 
short-term market interest rates in this situation. We study several of 
these tools, namely interest on excess reserves (IOER), reverse 
repurchase agreements (RRPs), and the term deposit facility (TDF). While
 IOER acts as primary means for supporting rates, we find that overnight
 RRPs (ON RRPs) provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because 
they are available to absorb daily liquidity shocks. Whether the TDF or 
RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the relative intensity of
 the frictions that banks face, which are bank balance sheet costs and 
interbank monitoring costs in our model. We show that when both costs 
are large, using the RRP and TDF concurrently most effectively raises 
short-term rates. While public money supplied by the Federal Reserve in 
the form of reserves can alleviate bank liquidity shocks by reducing 
interbank lending costs, large levels of reserve increase banks' balance
 sheet size and can induce greater bank moral hazard. RRPs can reduce 
levels of costly bank equity that banks are endogenously required to 
hold as a commitment device against risk-shifting returns on assets. 
This paper is the first to analyze the additional Federal Reserve tools 
and their effectiveness in controlling short-term money market rates and
 managing Federal Reserve liabilities. We provide positive-result 
predictions on the effects of the tools on a range of different money 
market interest rates and normative results that indicate the optimal 
quantity and composition of the provision of public and private money.</div>

 develop a tractable general equilibrium framework in which firms of 
heterogeneous quality and risk seek financing from competitive banks and
 public markets. Banks may add social value over public market investors
 due to differential monitoring cost, but may also privately benefit 
from a government guarantee on deposits. To alleviate risk-taking 
incentives of banks, regulators set equity ratio requirements based on 
public signals of risk. Our analysis provides an exact characterization 
of the economy-wide capital allocation and funding terms as a function 
of capital requirements. Its predictions are consistent with observed 
"reaching for yield" behavior of banks given pre-crisis regulation. The 
framework lends itself to evaluate the system-wide effects of proposals 
to increase capital requirements and eliminate risk-weights. Our robust 
finding is that an increase in capital requirements can never decrease 
welfare as long as the banking sector's aggregate equity capital does 
not constrain its ability to fund protable projects. However, if the 
banking sector is capacity constrained, tighter capital requirements may
 cause more banks to engage in value-destroying risk-shifting. Such 
perverse effects are more likely to occur when banks' social advantages 
over public markets are small.</div>

 paper builds a quantitative general equilibrium model that features 
regulated commercial banks and unregulated shadow banks. All banks 
invest in the same risky technology. Bank deposits provide liquidity 
services to households. Commercial deposits are insured and  therefore 
deliver full liquidity services to households. In order to receive 
insurance protection, commercial banks are subject to a capital 
requirement. Shadow banks are unregulated and their debt is not insured.
 The liquidity services provided by shadow banking debt depend on the 
expected default rate of shadow banks.  We calibrate the model to the 
U.S. banking system using banks' regulatory filings and data from the 
Flow of Funds. We use the model to study and quantify the effects of 
financial regulation and its unintended consequences. An increase in the

 consider the problem of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for a

econometrics. We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency 
bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these 
results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic 
results when the error distribution is not known. When the function 
class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs
 are close to efficient at smooth regression functions. This implies, in
 particular, that it is impossible to form CIs that are tighter using 
data-dependent tuning parameters, and maintain coverage over the whole 
function class. We specialize our results to inference in a linear

 paper considers two-sided tests for the parameter of an endogenous

weighted-average power (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known 
long-run variance. We introduce two weights which are invariant to 
orthogonal transformations of the instruments; e.g., changing the order 
in which the instruments appear. While tests using the MM1 weight can be
 severely biased, optimal tests based on the MM2 weight are naturally 
two-sided when errors are homoskedastic. We propose two boundary 
conditions that yield two-sided tests whether errors are homoskedastic 
or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the power 
around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than 
unbiasedness. The strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive 
than LU, but the associated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several 
tests are SU in finite samples or asymptotically, including tests robust
 to weak IV (such as the Anderson-Rubin, score, conditional 
quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews' (2015) PI-CLC tests) and 
two-sided tests which are optimal when the sample size is large and 
instruments are strong. We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our 
weights as MM1-SU and MM2-SU tests. Dropping the restrictive assumptions
 of normality and known variance, the theory is shown to remain valid at
 the cost of asymptotic approximations. The MM2-SU test is optimal under
 the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other existing tests under 
the weak IV asymptotics.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21759_abstract">This
 paper is about the empirical measurement of state dependence in dynamic
 binary outcomes. Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the 
estimation of parametric dynamic binary response (DBR) panel data 
models. Identification in these models requires extensive assumptions 
about functional form, heterogeneity and the exogeneity of covariates. 
In contrast, I focus on what can be learned from the data under easily 
interpretable nonparametric assumptions. To do this, I propose a dynamic
 potential outcomes (DPO) model and develop nonparametric counterparts 
of the parameters and assumptions considered in the traditional DBR 
literature. I show how to construct sharp identified sets in the DPO 
model using a flexible linear programming procedure that is valid for a 
large variety of parameters and auxiliary identifying assumptions. 
Confidence regions for these identified sets are obtained by applying 
recent results from the literature on inference in moment inequality 
models. The analysis is applied to study state dependence in the labor 
force participation of married women. Using conservative, nonparametric 
assumptions, it is possible to reject the hypothesis that there is no 
state dependence in the labor force participation outcomes of married 
women.</div>

estimated at a rate slower than √N but the integral over time of the 
dynamic causal effect is estimated at the regular rate, √N, where N is 
the number of individuals. A competing risk model is a natural framework
 for time-varying regressors. In particular, if a flow or a transition

 consider consistent estimation of parameters in a structural model by 
Indirect Inference (I-I) when the exogenous variables can be missing at 
random (MAR) endogenously. We demonstrate that existing implementations 
of I-I, which simply discard sample units with missing observations, may
 not work if the missing data mechanism is not properly reproduced by 
the simulations needed to identify the binding function. The celebrated 
bias correction property of I-I will not hold anymore if one just omits 
simulated observations in the same way they are missing in the observed 
sample. However, when remaining true to the common practice of not 
simulating the exogenous variables, the only way to get a proper 
selection mechanism in simulated samples is to cumulate two consecutive 
selection processes (one in observed sample, one in simulated sample) 
leading to a less informative new binding function. The main idea of 
this paper is to note that, by inverse probability weighting (IPW) the 
“complete case” observations, i.e., sample units with no missing 
variables for the observed and simulated samples, one is actually able 
to remain true to the initial binding function without creating 
selection bias in the simulated data or paying the efficiency price of 
implementing a missing data mechanism in the simulated samples. Hence, 
we propose a new IPW-based I-I that solves both problems and, 
subsequently, estimates the structural parameters accurately. Asymptotic
 properties of the new estimator are discussed. An illustration is 
provided based on a multinomial probit model.</div>

In other disciplines, a Bayesian approach known as Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) is far more popular. This paper connects these two seemingly related approaches
to likelihood-free estimation
by means of a Reverse  Sampler that
 uses both optimization and importance weighting to target the posterior distribution.
 Its hybrid features enable
 us to analyze an ABC estimate from the perspective of SMD. We show
that an ideal ABC estimate can be obtained as a weighted average of a sequence of
SMD modes, each being the minimizer of the deviations between the data and
the  model. This contrasts with the SMD, which is the mode of  the average deviations.
 Using stochastic expansions, we provide a general characterization
 of  frequentist estimators and those based on
 Bayesian computations including Laplace-type estimators. Their differences  are illustrated using  analytical examples

The asymptotic behavior of the test statistic is determined under a full
 range of drifting sequences of true distributions.  The results are 
based on a construction of the test statistic in terms of Hermite 
polynomials.  The number of terms in the polynomial construction depends
 on the size of the parameter space.  Using this relation, a collection

context of non-linear models allowing for multiple switching parameters.
 The analysis simultaneously addresses three difficulties: (i) some 
nuisance parameters are unidentified under the null hypothesis, (ii) the
 null hypothesis yields a local optimum, and (iii) conditional regime 
probabilities follow stochastic processes that can only be represented 
recursively. Addressing these issues permits substantial power gains in 
empirically relevant situations. Besides obtaining the tests’ asymptotic
 distributions, this paper also obtains four sets of results that can be
 of independent interest: (1) a characterization of conditional regime 
probabilities and their high order derivatives with respect to the 
model’s parameters, (2) a high order approximation to the log likelihood
 ratio permitting multiple switching parameters, (3) a refinement to the
 asymptotic distribution, and (4) a unified algorithm for simulating the
 critical values. For models that are linear under the null hypothesis, 
the elements needed for the algorithm can all be computed analytically. 
The above results also shed light on why some bootstrap procedures can 
be inconsistent and why standard information criteria, such as the 
Bayesian information criterion (BIC), can be sensitive to the hypothesis
 and the model’s structure. When applied to the US quarterly real GDP 
growth rates, the methods suggest fairly strong evidence favoring the 
regime switching specification, which holds consistently over a range of
 sample periods.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21793_abstract">This
 paper introduces a model with regime switching, which is driven by an 
autoregressive latent factor correlated with the innovation to the 
observed time series. In our model, the mean or volatility process is 
switched between two regimes, depending upon whether the underlying 
autoregressive latent factor takes values above or below some threshold 
level. If the latent factor becomes exogenous, our model reduces to the 
conventional markov switching model, and therefore, our model may be 
regarded as an extended markov switching model allowing for endogeneity 
in regime switching. Our model is estimated by the maximum likelihood 
method using a newly developed modified markov switching filter. For 
both mean and volatility models that are frequently analyzed in markov 
switching framework, we demonstrate that the presence of endogeneity in 
regime switching is indeed strong and ubiquitous.</div>

 inference with a small number of potentially heterogeneous clusters or 
groups of observations in a financial or economic model that exhibits 
heterogeneity, heavy-tailedness and dependence of a largely unknown 
type. Suppose estimating the model on each cluster yields q 
asymptotically unbiased, independent Gaussian estimators with 
potentially heterogeneous variances. Following an earlier work by the 
authors, one can then conduct asymptotically valid inference with a 
standard t-test based on the q cluster estimators, since at conventional
 significance levels, the small sample t-test remains valid under 
variance heterogeneity. This paper makes two contributions. First, we 
establish a new corresponding small sample result for the two-sample 
t-test under variance heterogeneity. One can therefore apply the robust 
large sample t-statistic based inference also for comparisons of 
parameters between two populations, such as treatment and control groups
 o r pre- and post-structural break (e.g., pre-crisis and crisis period)
 data. Second, we develop a test for the appropriate level of 
clustering, with the null hypothesis that clustered standard errors from
 a fine partition are correct, against the alternative that only q 
clusters provide asymptotically independent information. Applications of
 the new robust large sample inference approaches include, among others,
 robust analysis of treatment effects, structural breaks and the effects
 of crises and heavy-tailedness on financial and economic markets, as 
well as the robust analysis of volatility and autocorrelation structure 
of financial and economic time series under heavy-tailedness and 
dependence.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21795_abstract">Long-run
 restrictions (Blanchard and Quah, 1989) are a very popular method for 
identifying structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). A prominent 
example is the debate on the effect of technology shocks on employment, 
which has been used to test real business cycle theory (Gali, 1999, 
Christiano Eichenbaum and Vigfusson, 2003). The long-run identifying 
restriction is that non-technology shocks have no permanent effect on 
productivity. This can be used to identify the technology shock and the 
impulse responses to it. It is well-known that long-run restrictions can
 be expressed as exclusion restrictions in the SVAR and that they may 
suffer from weak identification when the degree of persistence of the 
instruments is high (Pagan and Robertson, 1998). This introduces 
additional nuisance parameters and entails nonstandard distributions, so
 standard weak-instrument-robust methods of inference are inapplicable. 
We develop a method of inference that is robust to this problem. The 
method is based on a combination of the Anderson and Rubin (1949) test 
with instruments derived by filtering potentially non-stationary 
variable to make them near stationary (Magdalinos and Phillips, 2009, 
Phillips, 2014, Kostakis Magdalinos and Stamatogiannis, 2015). In the 
case of Blanchard and Quah (1989), we find that long-run restrictions 
yield very weak identification. On the hours debate, we find that the 
difference specification of Gali (1999) is very well identified, while 
the level specification of Christiano et. al. (2003) is weakly 
identified.</div>

European firms over the January 2006 to June 2010 period. When the European Central Bank
(ECB) allocated liquidity to banks in a competitive tender at the beginning of the crisis, higher
“aggregate” central bank liquidity (i.e. the total liquidity in the banking system that is held at the
ECB) reduces bank deposit rates of low risk banks but has no effect on deposit rates of high risk
banks or on corporate loan spreads of high or low risk banks. After the ECB started to fully allot
all liquidity requested by banks via its refinancing operations on October 8, 2008, an increase in
liquidity decreases deposit rates of both high and low risk banks. While loan spreads of low risk
banks decrease, those of high risk banks remain unchanged also under full allotment of liquidity.
We find that borrowers of high risk banks refinance term loans drawing down loan commitments.
They have lower payouts, lower capital expenditures and lower asset growth compared with
borrowers of low risk banks. Our results suggest a differential transmission of central bank
liquidity of low versus high risk banks, and an impaired transmission to corporate borrowers of
high risk banks.</div>

 liquidity creation in shadow banking vulnerable to self-fulfilling 
runs? Investors typically decide to withdraw simultaneously, making it 
challenging to identify self-fulfilling runs. In this paper, we exploit 
the contractual structure of funding agreement-backed securities offered
 by U.S. life insurers to institutional investors. The contracts allow 
us to obtain variation in investors’ expectations about other investors’
 actions that is plausibly orthogonal to changes in fundamentals. We 
find that a run on U.S. life insurers during the summer of 2007 was

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14522_abstract">Most
 of the empirical evidence has shown that the majority of oil dependent 
countries have the low level of financial development; thus, they are 
much more volatile and exposed to the oil chocks and the so named “oil 
curse”. This paper aims to investigate in the impact of the Algerian 
financial system, as one of major oil economies, on the economic growth 
and escaping the oil curse. Over the past two decades, Algeria has 
courageously attempted to modernize its financial system despite social 
strife and challenges posed by the large hydrocarbon sector and an 
inefficient public sector. In fact, various reforms have been undertaken
 since the early 1990s to the transition from planned to an open market 
economy.&lt;br /&gt;
          So, the first section provides the research background based 
on a theoretical model and a set of empirical studies about financial 
development and the oil curse. An analytical framework of the Algerian 
financial system evolution is provided in the second section, focusing 
on the two phases: 1990-1999 and 2000-2011. Finally, using an 
econometric growth regression model to test the impact of financial 
development in Algeria over the period 1990-2011, the preliminary 
results show that the financial development enhanced economic growth but
 it has not contributed in reducing the negative effect of oil rents.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14523_abstract">Human-induced
 climate change has been one of the most widely discussed issues of 
scientific and political spheres in the recent decades, and it has been 
overwhelmingly agreed that climate change poses a very serious threat 
for the environment and the economy. It has been observed that 
increasing temperatures and extremities in weather patterns create a 
serious challenge for  agriculture and food security especially in 
various disadvantaged regions. Even in the most optimistic scenarios, 
where global mean temperatures rise by around 2oC by 2100, serious 
negative effects are expected on agricultural production and crop yields
 over the next century.
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is one of the most vulnerable 
regions as one of the most food-import dependent region in the world. 
Water resources are scarce and irrigation is not sufficiently developed 
in the region, and climate change hurts the already vulnerable 
agricultural supply, where on the other hand increasing population 
continuously fosters the demand for agricultural products.
The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of climate change on 
agricultural trade in the MENA region. The indicators for climate change
 includes variables such as precipitation patterns and temperatures, and
 the effect of the change in the climate change indicators on 
agricultural exports and imports will be analyzed through a panel data 
analysis, where the impacts of GDP, per-capita oil use and trade 
integration will also be added as variables.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14524_abstract">As
 of 2013 Turkey’s per capita emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
 greenhouse gasses (CO2 eq.) stand at 4.037 tons, while its total CO2 
eq. emissions per $GDP reach to 0.308 kg.  Accordingly, Turkey displays a
 lower figure in emissions in both accounts in comparison to the world 
and OECD averages.  However, Turkey is cited among the top five 
countries that disclose the fastest rate of growth of aggregate CO2 eq. 
emissions. Turkey’s CO2 eq. emissions have increase from 188.5 million 
tons in 1990, to 403 million tons in 2013, and is expected to increase 
to 675 million tons by 2030 (Acar and Yeldan, 2015).  This suggests that
 Turkey will be on a divergent trend against many of the emerging market
 developing economies as well as the world averages over the next 
decades.

A key hypothesis in this paper is that the projected lack of decoupling 
between growth and emissions mitigation is mostly driven by the 
dualistic patterns of growth and industrialization across regions in 
Turkey.  We proceed with a detailed assessment of regional and sectoral 
gaseous emissions for the Turkish economy and detect whether patterns of
 CO2 emissions reveal convergence.  This study merits as being one of 
the leading research on regional growth and emissions, and problems of 
dualistic development within the context of a developing emerging market
 economy.</div>

 Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) declared that 
‘warming of the climate system is unequivocal’. Changes in temperatures 
and other climatic features will vary globally. The regions affected by 
these extreme events, including many major tourism destinations, will 
increase. Tourism is a leading sector in many of the Mediterranean 
countries, including some  of the  MENA.  It has the potential to lift 
people out of poverty through the employment and entrepreneurial 
opportunities it provides, and the recognition of tourism’s role in 
poverty alleviation has made it a substantial component of the 
international development and trade agenda.  The tourist industry is by 
its very nature fragile and susceptible to political, economic and

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14526_abstract">This
 paper investigates the discrepancy between the vast natural resource 
wealth and the relatively low spending on human development in the 
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. While the experiences of 
MENA countries in fact served as an inspiration for the theory on 
“rentier states” that lies at the basis of much of the literature on the
 political economy of the resource curse, empirical evidence on the 
relationship between natural resources and economic and human 
development in this region is scarce. This paper is the first to 
empirically explore the nexus of natural resource wealth and public 
social spending in MENA countries. Using a panel dataset covering the 
period from 1995 to 2009, our results show a robust, significant inverse
 relationship between natural resource dependence and public health 
spending, and natural resource dependence and public education spending 
over time. The effect remains significant even after controlling for 
income, aid, the age structure of the population, and the quality of 
institutions. Moreover, we find a particularly strong resource curse 
effect of oil dependence on public social spending. Despite the mounting
 burden on MENA‘s economic development models due to significant 
population growth and the pressing need for diversification, countries 
have been unable or unwilling to convert natural resource wealth into 
increased social spending. Governments should be strongly encouraged to 
manage their natural wealth in an accountable and equitable manner that 
follows international best practice. Correct taxation of natural 
resource, and especially, oil wealth should provide the governments with
 adequate budgets to fund a desirable level of public health provision. 
Finally, the equity of distribution of education spending could be 
improved.</div>

 performance of students in blended and traditional versions of an 
introductory statistics course is compared within the context of the 
students' prior academic achievement.  The blended version of the course
 uses a combination of flipped and flexible instructional modes, where 
lectures are only available online, class periods are used for 
complimentary learning activities, and there is no punitive attendance 
policy.  We find significant differences in student performance between 
the blended and traditional versions within two of three zones of grade 
point averages.  Additionally, empirical models of student performance 
are prepared for the blended and traditional versions of the course.  
Partial effects from grade point average and other predictor variables 
upon student performance in the blended version are significantly 
different from the partial effects of those same variables upon student 
performance in the traditional version.  In particular, grade point 
average and attendance have larger partial effects upon student 
performance in the blended version than in the traditional version.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21632_abstract">Since
 their inception nearly 180 years ago, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) have provided African American students with the 
best mechanism, and for some, the only opportunity to receive a 
collegiate education. Justifications for and against the continued need 
for and existence of HBCUs have been raised and argued since the Brown 
decision in 1954 and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. More 
than 50 years after these monumental decisions HBCUs remain relatively 
segregated, with lower endowments, budgets, graduation rates and higher 
cohort default rates than Predominantly White Colleges and Universities 
(PWCUs). Despite the confluence of lower average admission requirements,
 less funding for institutional scholarships, limited technological 
resources and smaller operating budgets than PWCU’s, HBCUs have 
persevered in providing higher educational opportunities not only for 
African Americans, but for students of all races. In Georgia, 7 
institutions of higher education have the HBCU designation. This paper 
adds to the literature on the purpose and effectiveness of HBCUs in 
Georgia and uses a Chow test to provide an analysis of the structural 
differences in production functions between Georgia HBCUs and PWCUs. 
Further ordered logistic regression is employed to analyze the impact of
 financial variables on graduation rates and cohort default rates. 
Finally policy implications and recommendations are presented.</div>

 study uses Current Population Survey data, from 2000 to 2007-2013, to 
examine the wage premium in durable manufacturing jobs in the Detroit 
Metropolitan area. Preliminary decomposition results show the durables 
wage premium declined slightly, but remained significant in 2013. Over 
the period, the way that some factors influenced wages changed. Returns 
to education had been lower for workers in durables than in the other 
sectors in 2000. However, by 2007-13 education returns were higher for 
durables workers than for workers in other sectors. This is an important
 finding for two reasons: It suggests a redistribution of wages by 
education is occurring within the sector; and it duplicates a documented
 trend in the US and Europe of increasing returns to education. Past 
manufacturing employment paid higher wages to workers regardless of 
occupation. Preliminary results suggest this is not the case for 
durables workers in our sample. Professional and managerial occupations 
pay higher earnings in durables, but not operative, clerical and 
craftwork.</div>

we identify a delayed effect of HIV-AIDS on economic growth: the growth 
rate gap between the AIDS and no-AIDS scenarios is rather stable between
 2010 and 2020, but then it gets sharply larger between 2020 and 2030,

 the theoretical literature connects public spending to growth, 
individual empirical findings are conflicting. I propose that 
inefficiencies in public spending might explain these inconsistencies. I
 use a dataset from developing countries observed over the period of 
1995 to 2010, and consider the endogeneity of public education spending 
and corruption. The GMM estimates demonstrate that the efficiency of 
public spending on growth depends on a country's level of corruption. 
These results suggest that mere increases in
spending are a poor substitute for institutional improvements and 
growth-enhancing public policy.

 frequently start a class discussion of “Supply and Demand” with a 
simple question to anyone in the class.  If you were a pizza producer, 
how many pizzas would you produce at a price of $15 a pie?   Students 
give me a blank stare.  I then elaborate.  Consumers will have some idea
 of how many pizzas they will buy at any given price, assuming other 
“shift factors” like income, taste, and expectations do not markedly 
change, but producers can estimate how much they will produce at any 
given price only if they know something about demand conditions.  
Demand, however, is not a shift factor for the supply curve. Quite the 
contrary. The supply curve of introductory economics textbooks is 
supposed to be completely independent of demand. Demand is supposed to 
have no influence on the position or shape of the supply curve. Though 
this is well-known to economists, it is absent from introductory text 
D&amp;S chapters.     In this paper I will: a) describe a simple 
workable “demand and cost” (D&amp;C) alternative to the S&amp;D meme 
that serves to undermine the free-market ideology that underlies the 
S&amp;D fable, and replace it with a solidly Keynesian and Polanyi – ish
 understanding of the role of social choice and social policy in 
creating markets.  The paper will summarize parts of a book that I am 
working on: “The Morality of Radical Economics: Investigating the Value 
Neutral Aspect of Neoclassical Economics,” to be published (assuming I 
finish the manuscript) in 2016 by Palgrave Press.</div>

concepts and information usually seen as the province of sociology and

powerful) and how they interact with one another, as well as how wealth 
feeds into power and power into wealth. It argues further that studying

 good way to naturally introduce these topics.</div>

 provide an empirical assessment of the German interurban bus industry 
two years after its deregulation in January 2013. In addition to a 
general description of key developments of the industry, we use a unique
 route-level price data set to study both competitive interaction in 
general and the potential price effects of a recently announced merger 
of the two largest players in the market in particular. We find that 
route-level average prices, inter alia, do not only depend on the number
 of competitors but especially on the composition of firms operating on a
 particular route. Although our empirical results suggest short-term 
price increases on certain route types post-merger, it remains an open

 paper considers the effects of small and mid-size commercial airports 
on their local economies over the post World War II period, specifically
 1950-2010. To estimate these effects, I use a detailed, novel dataset 
of Census Based Statistical Area (CBSA) level employment outcomes, 
geographic, transportation, and city characteristics, along with 
previously unexploited historical aviation data. Using an instrumental 
variables approach with three instruments – the locations of collection 
points on the Air Mail system of 1938, a network of Federally 
constructed emergency air fields in the early years of aviation, and a 
1922 plan of airways for national defense – as well as two alternative 
estimators – one-to-one Mahalanobis distance matching with caliper and 
pooled synthetic controls – I show that airports have had substantial 
effects on CBSA population and employment over time. Specifically, I 
find that relative to non-airport cities, the presence of an airport in a
 CBSA has caused population growth ranging between 14.6 percent
and 29 percent, total employment growth of between 17.4 percent and 36.6
 percent, tradable industry employment growth of between 26.6 percent 
and 42.6 percent, and non-tradable industry employment growth of between
 a non-statistically significant 2.7 percent and 16.1 percent. These 
effects vary by region, city size, and traffic levels. Most of these 
growth effects occurred over two periods: first, at the beginning of the
 post-war period, 1950-1960, and then, during the formative years of the
 jet age, 1970-1980, after which the effects of aviation remained 
constant. The larger effect on tradable industry employment implies that
 the overall employment and population effects may result from direct 
effects on tradable sector industry productivity, perhaps by 
facilitating information flows. Effects vary by initial city size and 
region, and are generally robust to the choice of instruments and/or 
estimator.</div>

drastically, which  is partially due to the increasing demand for ‘just 
in time’ delivery of intermediate goods as well as due to the growing 
importance of trade between more distant countries. In this paper we 
analyze the effect of trade facilitation or improved logistics on 
transport mode choice in international trade. For this purpose we 
develop a continuous modal choice model, which produces a composite 
transportation service using a mix of air-land or air-water 
transportation inputs. We then estimate the associated elasticities of 
substitution between transport modes. We find that modal substitution 
elasticities have a typical value of 0.9 to 2.8. The quality of 
logistics infrastructure is also estimated to alter modal choice in 
international trade. In order to draw out the implications of these 
empirical findings for global trade patterns, international transport 
use, and regional economic welfare, we then incorporate the modal choice
 model into the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model of global 
trade. Not surprisingly, we find that improvement in logistics reduces 
the overall cost of transport and amount of services required to 
transport a given product along a given route by a given mode. Also, the
 reduction in modal cost of transport results in modal substitution. We 
find that in some regions improvement in logistics increases the use of 
air transport, while in others it reduces the demand for both air and 
water transportation, having a larger negative effect on maritime 
transport and, thus, resulting in a relatively increased use of air 
transportation.</div>

 paper evaluates the impact from the launch of New York City's Citibike 
program on the city's medallion taxi industry. We study over 800 million
 NYC taxi trip records for 2009 through 2014, matching origin and 
destination coordinates to a grid of 2,930 hexagonal cells covering New 
York's five boroughs. We treat each cell as a distinct origin or 
destination and measure changes to the flow of trips, and the search 
intensity of taxi drivers, following the launch of Citibike on May 27, 
2013. A (preliminary) difference-in-difference result compares 
cell-pairs for which both cells in the pair contain a Citibike station 
(such that it would be possible to complete a trip on the pair with a 
Citibike ride and minimal walking) to all other cell-pairs in NYC, both 
before and after the introduction of Citibike in May 2013. We find an 
average reduction of 2.1 taxi-trips trips per day for treated relative 
to control cell-pairs following the introduction of Citibike. Since a 
total of 114 cells were treated with a Citibike station, this amounts to
 a total difference of 27,000 trips per day, which represents about 5.5%
 of daily taxi trips in NYC, or the level of transportation service 
provided by 740 taxis.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13619_abstract">In
 this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal 
effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting 
inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects 
across subsets of the population. In most of the literature on 
supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, 
LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a
 unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these 
methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to 
actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of 
complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our 
method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for 
predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. 
The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not 
observed for any individual unit. We propose several novel 
cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through 
simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard
 methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to 
applications, including a large-scale field experiment re-ranking 
results on a search engine.</div>

 ability to collect, fuse, and analyze large amounts of data from online
 and mobile services has increased leaps and bounds with respect to just
 10 years ago.  In addition, cloud solutions promise to liberate us from
 the burdens of hardware equipment lifecycle management (including 
storage).  Furthermore, several vendors and consultant firms offer 
software packages running on top of the cloud that include state of the 
art statistical and machine learning software. As if all of that were 
not enough to be excited about, we have also similar facilities to 
execute online experiments using A/B testing platforms (and extensions 
in the form of Multi-Armed-Bandits). Thus, we can analyze 
multi-dimensional multi-modal data, formulate hypothesis, and then 
test/verify the causal direction of those hypothesis before acting and 
changing policies. We can then gradually and systematically increase the
 population that receives the preferred treatment, and effectively act 
on these hypotheses, all in record time. Yet, just as before all this 
technology became available, the dangers of: (i) not carefully verifying
 models, (ii) ignoring biases in the  data and statistical significance 
in experiments, (iii) not updating models once action is taken, and many
 other factors, present land mines that may prevent us from reaching pot

 paper explores the uniformity of inference for parameters of interest 
in nonlinear models with endogeneity. Due to potential endogeneity, the 
behavior of standard estimators of these parameters is shown to vary by 
where they lie in the parameter space. Consequently, inference becomes 
nonstandard in a fashion that is loosely analogous to the unit root and 
weak instruments literature. Our main illustrative example is the 
standard sample selection model, where the parameter is the intercept 
term. We show that with selection on unobservables, asymptotic theory 
for estimating this parameter is not standard, with nonparametric rates 
and non-Gaussian limiting distributions. In contrast if the selection is
 known to be on observables only, rates and asymptotic distribution can 
be standard, and consequently, there is a discontinuity in the limiting 
distribution theory for an estimator despite it being uniformly 
consistent. This discontinuity prevents standard inference procedures 
from being uniformly valid, and motivates the development of new 
methods, for which we establish asymptotic properties. These new methods
 require very large datasets and we demonstrate the approach using click
 logs from a major search engine. Here the goal is estimate the causal 
impact of the advertising link and the confound is the presence of the 
“organic” link on the page (“cannabilization”). We examine the 
properties of the estimator using “ground truth” from a fully randomized

 markets are incomplete, cultural norms may play a greater role in 
shaping economic behavior. In this paper, we explore whether the 
practice of bride price -- a transfer made by the groom to the bride's 
family at marriage -- increases the probability of child marriages. We 
develop a simple model in which households are exposed to income shocks 
and have no access to credit markets and show that parents have a higher
 probability of marrying their daughter early when hit by adverse income
 shocks. We test the prediction of the model by exploiting variation in 
rainfall shocks over a woman's life cycle. Using a 19-years panel 
dataset from Tanzania, we find that adverse shocks during teenage years 
increase the probability of early marriages, particularly in the 
sub-sample of respondents who report a bride price payment at marriage. 
Numerical simulations of our theoretical model show that improving 
access to credit markets could substantially delay the age of marriage.</div>

 South Asia, parents prize sons for both economic and cultural reasons,

the household. However, using data from Bangladesh and India, we show 
that such high regard does not necessarily translate into improved 
autonomy. In fact, a daughter raises her mother’s participation in 
household decisions and her freedom of mobility relative to a son. A 
daughter also prompts her mother to work more but not necessarily to 
consume more. These effects are strongest among older girls. We argue 
that these results suggest a model in which mothers have greater

 industrial development empower women in developing countries? This is 
the first paper to explore the causal effects of a continent-wide 
exogenous expansion of industry on female empowerment and infant health.
 The paper uses the recent rapid increase in gold mining in Africa as a 
quasi-experiment. The identification strategy relies on temporal (before
 and after mine opening) and spatial (distance to mine) variation, as 
well as exogenous variation in the price of gold in a 
difference-in-difference analysis. Using a large sample of women and 
children living within 100km of a mine, the analysis shows that the 
establishment of a new mine increases income earning opportunities 
within the service sector by 41%, a woman is 23% less likely to state a 
barrier to healthcare access for herself, and the acceptance rate of 
domestic violence decreases by 24%. Despite risks of environmental 
pollution from gold mining, infant mortality more than halves with the 
mine opening. In particular, girl infants face better chances of 
survival. I exclude the possibility that effects are driven by increased
 schooling attainment made possible by investment in schooling 
infrastructure, or that service jobs are limited to prostitution. I 
cannot rule out that urbanization is part of the mechanism. The findings
 are robust to different assumptions about trends, distance, migration, 
and withstand a novel spatial randomization test. The results support 
the idea that entrenched norms regarding gender can change rapidly in 
the presence of economic development.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12958_abstract">If
 the Northeast was the cradle of American feminism, why was it 
originally less permissive on women’s rights than the West? The 
frontier’s early progressive stance is especially striking considering 
its predominantly male population. What explains this apparent paradox? 
In this paper, we use an instrumental variables approach to test the 
evolving relationship between the demand for female settlement and 
women’s wellbeing in the United States. We hypothesize that states where
 the sex ratio in the prime marriage-age population skewed strongly 
male—like the frontier states of the West—fostered an egalitarian 
environment to attract the female migrants necessary for long-term 
settlement and population growth. Over time and as the sex ratio 
equalized, it is possible that the need to maintain such female-friendly
 policies diminished, and that women’s circumstances in these regions 
deteriorated accordingly. To test the drivers and consequences of 
women’s empowerment, we leverage a new state-level panel dataset on 
American women’s economic, social, and legal standing, 1870-1970, and we
 instrument for the state-year sex ratio using data on precious metal 
mining booms. We find that states that were highly male tended to be 
more female-friendly in matters of policy and intra-household status, 
and that a female-friendly institutional climate, particularly in 
matters of suffrage, political representation, and education, was indeed
 effective at drawing female settlement. While the demand for female 
settlement by itself was not a significant driver of policy, there 
appear to be heterogeneous effects of the sex ratio on policy both by 
access to the polity and by suitability for arable agriculture. In 
examining the mechanisms by which culture and institutions regarding 
women may have evolved and spread, we find, for instance, that policies 
such as female suffrage are highly spatially correlated, with patterns 
that suggest a social learning model of policy diffusion.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13149_abstract">The
 persistence of occupations across generations is an important barrier 
to reducing long run inequality in developing countries. In this paper, 
we examine whether trade liberalization, by changing the distribution of
 occupations and the returns to higher-skilled occupations, can allow 
children to escape such occupational traps and enter occupations that 
are better than their parents. In particular, we exploit India's 
dramatic trade reforms of 1991 to causally examine the relationship 
between trade liberalization and intergenerational occupational 
mobility. Our results suggest that a son residing in a district with 
greater exposure to trade liberalization is more likely to be in an 
occupation that is higher ranked than that of his father. This result 
holds when we restrict the sample to sons who have fathers that were in 
the bottom half of the fathers' occupational distribution. This suggests
 that trade liberalization, by allowing sons from low-income backgrounds
 to enter better occupations than their father, has attenuated the 
intergenerational persistence of occupations in India</div>

 number of recent studies report substantial and across-the-board 
improvements in educational mobility in post-reform India using 
intergenerational regression coefficient (IGRC) as the measure of 
immobility. However, the IGRC estimates are likely to be severely biased
 downward in commonly used data sets because of coresident sample 
selection. In contrast, sibling correlation (SC) and intergenerational 
correlation (IGC) suffer from very little bias because truncation due to
 coresidency restriction affects both the slope of an OLS regression and
 also the variance of the truncated variable. We present estimates of SC
 and IGC in schooling, and find evidence that contradicts the current 
consensus.  The evidence indicates very low educational mobility in 
India, lower than in Latin America, which remained largely unchanged 
over a decade of economic liberalization from 1991/92 to 2006, 
especially for men. The estimates of sibling and intergenerational 
correlations among men do not show any improvements in urban areas over 
the reform period, and may have increased slightly in rural areas. 
Although the sibling and intergenerational correlations among women have
 declined irrespective of geographic location, only women in urban areas
 have experienced a measurable decline.  Interestingly, among the urban 
women, there are significant caste differences: the lower caste women 
have experienced significantly better educational mobility compared to 
the upper caste women. We also find that neighborhood effect constitutes
 an important part of educational inequality as measured by sibling 
correlation, which is different from the available evidence on developed
 countries.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13151_abstract">This
 study provides a first systematic analysis of the temporal patterns of 
cross-sectional inequality and intergenerational mobility amid China’s 
economic transition and growth. We estimate the patterns of 
intergenerational mobility in income and education with respect to 
cohort, gender, and region in China using micro data from the Chinese 
Household Income Projects in 1995 and 2002, and the 2010 Chinese Family 
Panel Studies. Our results show that intergenerational mobility in both 
income and education declines sharply along with the economic 
transition. In addition, we find that the decreasing trend is 
particularly significant for females and residents from economically 
disadvantaged regions, such as rural and western parts. We correlate 
intergenerational mobility with cross-sectional inequality, and find a 
Great Gatsby Curve with a negative slope in China. It indicates that the
 intergenerational mobility has declined with the increase in 
cross-sectional inequality since the economic reform. Children from poor
 families benefit less from the economic growth than rich families do. 
Given the decline in the intergenerational mobility, the cross-sectional
 inequality may increase in the future. To interpret these patterns, we 
then develop a conceptual framework from the human-capital perspective 
(Becker &amp; Tomes, 1979, 1986; Solon, 2004; Corak, 2013). We explain 
the changes through five factors: household income, government policies 
on human-capital investment, return to human capital, cost of education,
 and income inequality. Our estimated decline in intergenerational 
mobility in the reform period implies that the effect of the latter 
three factors dominates that of the former two.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13152_abstract">This
 paper relaxes the single factor model of intergenerational educational 
mobility and analyzes heterogeneous effects of family background on 
children's education in rural China, with a focus on the role of 
non-farm occupations over the reform period. We use data that cover 
three generations spanning pre and post reform periods, and are not 
subject to sample selection due to coresidency criterion used to define 
household membership in the surveys. The evidence shows that the mean 
effects of parents’ education miss substantial heterogeneity across 
farm-nonfarm occupations. Having nonfarm parents has positive effects, 
but there is clear gender and time difference: the effect is much 
stronger for boys during the reform era. Although the low educated 
non-farmer parents have 30 percent higher income, their children do not 
enjoy any advantages over the children of more educated farmer parents 
in both the pre- and post-reform generations. Estimates of cross-partial
 effects without imposing arbitrary functional form show little evidence
 of complementarity between parental education and non-farm occupation 
in producing children’s human capital, and this is true for both 
generations. This contradicts the notion that positive feedback between 
education and non-farm occupation may be important for the widening 
inequality in rural China following economic liberalization. The role of
 family background remains relatively stable across generations for 
girls, but for boys, family background has become more important after 
the market reform. We explore causality using three approaches: 
Rosenbaum sensitivity analysis, minimum biased IPW estimator and 
heteroskedasticity based identification. Our results suggest that the 
advantages of having more educated parents, especially with nonfarm 
occupations, are unlikely to be due solely to selection on genetic 
transmissions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12157_abstract">We
 propose a model of firm volatility based on customer-supplier 
connectedness. We assume that customers' growth rate shocks influence 
the growth rates of their suppliers, larger suppliers have more 
customers, and the strength of a customer-supplier link depends on the 
size of the customer firm. When the size distribution becomes more 
dispersed, economic activity is concentrated among a smaller number of 
firms, the typical supplier becomes less diversified and its volatility 
increases. The model is consistent with a set of new stylized facts. At 
the macro level, the firm volatility distribution is driven by firm size
 dispersion; the latter explains common movements in firm-level total 
and residual volatility. At the micro level, we show that the 
concentration of customer networks is an important determinant of 
firm-level volatility.</div>

 study the impact of uncertainty shocks for corporate financing

 is the macroeconomic effect of having a substantial number of firms 
close to default? This paper studies the effects of financial distress 
in a model where customers, suppliers and workers suffer losses if their
 employer goes bankrupt. I show that this mechanism generates 
amplification of fundamental shocks by creating a cyclical TFP and labor
 macroeconomic wedges. Because the strength of this amplification 
depends on the share of firms that are in financial distress, it 
operates mostly in recessions, when equity values are low. This leads 
macroeconomic volatility to be endogenously countercyclical. Moreover, 
the cross-sectional dispersion of firms' outcomes is also endogenously 
countercyclical. Empirical evidence consistent with the model is

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12160_abstract">We
 study aggregate fluctuations in an economy where firms have persistent 
differences in total factor productivities, capital and debt or 
financial assets. Investment is funded by retained earnings and 
non-contingent debt. Firms may default upon loans, and this risk leads 
to a unit cost of borrowing that rises with the level of debt and falls 
with the value of collateral. On average, larger firms, those with more 
collateral, have higher levels of investment than smaller firms with 
less collateral. Since large and small firms draw from the same 
productivity distribution, this implies an insufficient allocation of 
capital in small firms and thus reduces aggregate total factor 
productivity, capital and GDP.
We consider business cycles driven by shocks to aggregate total factor 
productivity and by credit shocks. The latter are financial shocks that 
worsen firms’ cash on hand and reduce the fraction of collateral lenders
 can seize in the event of default. In equilibrium, our nonlinear loan 
rate schedules drive countercyclical default risk and exit, alongside 
procyclical entry. Because a negative productivity shock raises default 
probabilities, it leads to a modest reduction in the number of firms and
 a deterioration in the allocation of capital that amplifies the effect 
of the shock. The recession following a negative credit shock is 
qualitatively different from that following a productivity shock, and 
more closely resembles the 2007 U.S. recession in several respects. A 
rise in default and a substantial fall in entry yield a large decline in
 the number of firms. Measured TFP falls for several periods, as do 
employment, investment and GDP, and the ultimate declines in investment 
and employment are large relative to that in TFP. Moreover, the recovery
 following a credit shock is gradual given slow recoveries in TFP, 
aggregate capital, and the measure of firms.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12276_abstract">The
 widely viewed children’s television program Sesame Street was 
introduced in November 1969 as an educational, early childhood program 
with the explicit goal of preparing preschool age children for school 
entry and beyond. Early studies found sizable short-term effects on 
cognitive test scores that are comparable in magnitude to the documented
 effects of participation in other early childhood education programs. 
In this project, we provide additional evidence of the effects of early 
childhood exposure to Sesame Street programming on later outcomes. We 
exploit county-level variation in TV viewers' ability to watch the show 
when it was first introduced, primarily generated by limited reception 
for those living in areas where Sesame Street was broadcast over UHF 
channels. We use Census data to explore how this variation relates to 
outcomes including grade-for-age status in 1980, educational attainment 
in 1990, and labor market outcomes in 2000. Our empirical approach 
distinguishes individuals by birth cohort and geography to capture 
differences in potential exposure. The results of our analysis indicate 
that children with greater access to the programming content during 
their early childhood years experienced improvements in early 
educational outcomes; that data do not offer strong evidence of 
persistent relative increases in ultimate educational attainment or 
labor market outcomes.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12277_abstract">Within
 the past decade, state-funded pre-Kindergarten has roughly doubled in 
its coverage of 4-year-olds, and expansion of such programs continues to
 make for policy debates. Although research has shown these programs can
 be effective at increasing test scores and later life outcomes in 
certain cases, existing studies have generally focused on small or 
state-specific programs that may not sufficiently capture program 
heterogeneity and thus may not generalize to other areas or programs. In
 this paper, we draw upon multiple data sources to exploit variation in 
enrollment in state-provided pre-Kindergarten programs across time and 
place to examine the effect of these programs on standardized test 
scores and other academic outcomes. Our data cover the last two decades 
and span all 50 states, and we investigate both program-level 
heterogeneity as well as heterogeneous impacts on different types of 
students and schools, accounting for the possibility of peer effects and
 spillovers. To our knowledge, this set of analyses is the first to 
provide national-level estimates of state-funded pre-Kindergarten access
 on academic outcomes. Finally, using back-of-the-envelope calculations,
 we discuss the implication of our estimates for earnings later in life 
and social mobility.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12278_abstract">There
 is growing concern that improving the academic skills of children in 
poverty is too difficult and costly once they reach adolescence, and so 
policymakers should instead focus either on vocationally oriented 
instruction or else on early childhood education. Yet this conclusion 
might be premature given that so few previous interventions have 
targeted a key barrier to school success: “mismatch” between what 
schools deliver and the needs of youth, particularly those far behind 
grade level. The researchers report on a randomized controlled trial of a
 school-based intervention that provides disadvantaged youth with 
intensive individualized academic instruction. The study sample consists
 of 2,718 male ninth and tenth graders in 12 public high schools on the 
south and west sides of Chicago, of whom 95 percent are either black or 
Hispanic and more than 90 percent are free- or reduced-price lunch 
eligible. Participation increased math achievement test scores by 0.19 
to 0.31 standard deviations (SD), depending on how the researchers 
standardize, increased math grades by 0.50 SD, and reduced course 
failures in math by one-half in addition to reducing failures in 
non-math courses. While some questions remain, these impacts on a 
per-dollar basis—with a cost per participant of around $3,800, or $2,500
 if delivered at larger scale—are as large as those of almost any other 
evaluated educational intervention.</div>

 shows that cognitive development in early childhood is best promoted if
 parents create learning opportunities for their children in the home 
environment. Unfortunately low-income children in the U.S. are far less 
likely than their advantaged counterparts to enjoy a cognitively 
stimulating home environment. This paper reports results from the 
“Parents and Children Together Study,” a randomized-control experiment 
designed to increase the amount of time low-income parents spend reading
 with their children. A total 160 participating parents borrowed an 
electronic tablet that had a recordable storybook app with over 500 
books in its digital library. The tablet collected objective data on the
 amount of parent-child reading time. The treatment group received a 
behaviorally-informed intervention that comprised a suite of behavioral 
“nudges,” including weekly goal setting, daily text-message reminders, 
visual feedback on weekly progress, and personal and peer recognition 
for meeting goals. Parents assigned to the control group receive the 
tablet with the storybook app and instructions for how to use it but 
none of the behavioral “nudges.” Results show that at the end of the 
6-week intervention, parents in the experimental group spent on average 
more than twice as much time reading with their children from the 
storybook app compared to parents in the control condition. This 
represents a statistically significant and very large treatment impact, 
suggesting substantial promise for the application of behavioral tools 
to parenting interventions to promote children’s human capital.</div>

 explore the role of product market structure on exchange rate 
pass-through and currency of invoicing in international trade, using 
very detailed transaction-level data on Canadian imports over a six-year
 period. A novel feature of the analysis is the importance of market 
share on both sides of the trading relationship--that of the exporting 
and importing firms. We find that both exchange rate pass-through and 
the currency of invoicing are dependent on the size (or market share) of
 both importers and exporters. Very small or very large exporters have 
higher rates of pass-through and tend to price in the exporters' 
currency; while it is the opposite for exporters in the middle range. By
 contrast, for larger importers, pass-through is lower and destination 
currency invoicing is more prevalent. These findings are consistent with
 a simple model of trade pricing under monopolistic competition with 
endogenous markups and heterogeneity in firm size (on both sides of the 
transaction).</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11240_abstract">This
 paper examines how economic sanctions impact the pattern of 
international trade and the welfare consequences. Sanctions have 
increasingly been used as a foreign policy tool since the end of the 
World Wars. The causes and actions of sanctions are often different 
rendering sanctions a useful intervention to empirically examine 
international trade: the primary causes of sanctions are political or 
military, e.g., conflict, human rights violation, proliferation, but 
sanctions are implemented primarily through economic means, i.e., 
restricting trade. Also the asymmetric nature sanctions - sanction 
targets are often low-income non-democratic countries whereas senders 
are richer democratic countries - could render significant welfare 
consequences. 

Specifically, I examine the impact of economic sanctions on (1) 
bilateral trade, (2) trade divergence in countries that are sanctioned 
by third party countries (the common enemy effect), (3) and welfare. 
Using the universe of sanctions and bilateral trade data between 1950 
and 2005, I find that sanctions reduce bilateral trade by 30%.  This 
average impact almost exactly offsets the impact of RTAs or FTAs that 
the literature finds. However, for less democratic countries the impact 
of sanctions is larger at about 44%. Second, sanctions divert trade 
towards other sanctioned countries, i.e., trade between two countries 
increase when both are sanctioned by third party countries. This effect 
is especially large for non-democratic country pairs. In other words, 
sanctions cause countries to increase trade with other rogue regimes. 
Lastly, despite the diversion of trade, sanctions reduce real GDP per 
capita by about 3% to 5% in less democratic countries. 

In sum, sanctions reshape the pattern of trade whereby less democratic 
regimes forge stronger trade relations with each other, and sanctions 
substantially reduce total welfare in target countries despite the fact 
that sanctions aim to punish and alter the actions of leaders.</div>

 paper analyzes the effects of output volatility shocks and of risk

two‐country world
with recursive preferences and complete financial markets. When the risk
 aversion coefficient
exceeds the inverse of the intertemporal substitution elasticity, then 
an exogenous rise in a

shocks resemble those of volatility shocks. In a recursive 
preferences-complete markets framework, volatility and risk appetite 
shocks account for a noticeable
share of the fluctuations of net exports, net foreign assets and the

fight excess volatility and exchange rate overshooting, the Central Bank
 of Brazil announced a major program of interventions in foreign

whether or not the intervention program was successful. Our results 
suggest that the first FX intervention program mitigated the 
depreciation of the real against the dollar. A second announcement made 
later in the year that the program was going to continue on a smaller

 conduct a randomized control trial that generates exogenous variation 
in the access to foreign markets for rug producers in Egypt. Combined 
with detailed survey data, we causally identify the impact of exporting 
on profits and productivity. Treatment firms report 15-25 percent higher
 profits and exhibit large improvements in quality alongside reductions 
in output per hour relative to control firms. These findings do not 
simply reflect firms being offered higher margins to manufacture 
high-quality products that take longer to produce. Instead, we find 
evidence of learning-by-exporting whereby exporting improves technical 
efficiency. First, treatment firms have higher productivity and quality 
after controlling for rug specifications. Second, when asked to produce 
an identical domestic rug using the same inputs and same capital 
equipment, treatment firms produce higher quality rugs despite no 
difference in production time. Third, treatment firms exhibit learning 
curves over time. Finally, we document knowledge transfers with quality 
increasing most along the specific dimensions that the knowledge 
pertained to.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12201_abstract">A
 growing literature has emphasized the role of Melitz-type firm 
heterogeneity within sectors in accounting for nominal income 
inequality. This paper explores the implications of firm heterogeneity 
for household price indices across the income distribution. Using 
detailed matched US home and store scanner microdata that allow us to 
trace the firm size distribution into the consumption baskets of 
individual households, we present evidence that richer US households 
source their consumption from on average significantly larger producers 
of brands within disaggregated product groups compared to poorer US 
households. We use the microdata to explore alternative explanations, 
write down a quantitative framework that rationalizes the observed 
moments, and estimate its parameters to quantify the underlying channels
 and explore model-based counterfactuals. Our central findings are that 
larger, more productive firms endogenously sort into catering to the 
taste of wealthier households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric 
effects on household price indices. We find that these price index 
effects significantly amplify observed nominal income inequalities in 
both the cross-section of households and for changes over time, and that
 they lead to a significantly more regressive distribution of the gains 
from international trade.</div>

 2008 to 2009 Germany experienced the deepest recession in its post-war 
history. But unlike in previous recessions or other countries, this 
sharp decline in output triggered no significant job losses. In fact, 
employment was even higher in the trough of the recession than at the 
pre-recession peak, while unemployment was lower. We investigate the 
reasons for the robust performance of the German labor market in the 
Great Recession. We analyze to what extent cyclical reductions in 
productivity and working time cushioned employment losses in previous 
recessions, and investigate the importance of these mechanisms in the 
Great Recession by applying time-series techniques to estimate 
counterfactual developments. To quantify the extent to which the 
reactions in productivity and working time were novel, we estimate 
time-series models explaining these two variables from 1970 until 2005. 
These estimates are used to create forecasts until 2012. This allows us 
to compare the actual development of cyclical productivity per hour, as 
well as the cyclical working time, with its counterfactual based on 
historical data. Our findings suggest that both pro-cyclical variations 
in hourly productivity and working time strongly contributed to 
safeguarding jobs in the Great Recession. However, we find the influence
 of cyclical working time reductions to be extraordinarily pronounced, 
while that of reductions in productivity is in line with historical 
evidence. Cyclical working-time reductions prevented an additional 
650.000 job losses, amounting to 1.6% of total employment. Using 
detailed information on instruments for the adjustment of working time, 
we uncover the institutional mechanisms behind this strong reduction. 
While short-time work played a significant role, equally important are 
working time accounts and discretionary variations in regular working 
time, two new instruments which have been established in the decade 
before the Great Recession.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11228_abstract">Productivity
 growth in construction is a classic problem.  Output deflators are 
scarce, so estimates of productivity growth, in total construction or in
 individual industries, are highly uncertain.  The NIPA accounts suggest
 that construction productivity has been declining for half a century, 
but many people find this hard to believe.
We prepare reliable measures of productivity growth in four industries 
in construction, using existing deflators or the new PPI deflators for 
construction industries.  Our results show productivity growth is 
positive and substantial in all four industries, which provides some 
evidence against the idea that productivity growth is negative.
Shifts of labor across construction industries reduce long-term 
productivity growth by 0.4 percent a year.  Increases in regulation have
 a statistically significant negative effect on productivity growth, but
 reduces productivity by only 0.1 percent a year.  Similarly, increases 
in the employment of undocumented immigrants, who are more likely to 
work off the books, reduces observed productivity by 0.1 percent 
annually. All these influences together are not sufficient to explain 
why productivity growth is so much lower in construction than in the 
rest of the economy.
Finally, we review our plans to use more of the new PPIs to measure 
productivity growth in more construction industries.  This will involve 
obtaining access to Census Bureau micro data, so that we can adjust the 
production data to conform to the industry boundaries at which the new 
PPIs are calculated.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14490_abstract">This
 paper aims to further our understanding of the labor supply choices of 
salaried employees by focusing on uncompensated overtime in jobs with 
pro-social characteristics. In the framework of this study, occupations 
differ in their social value, measured by the tendency of jobs to 
involve providing help or service to others. Examples of occupations 
that score high along this dimension include therapists, nurses and 
social workers. On the labor supply side, workers differ in the degree 
to which they value their job’s helping orientation.  The theoretical 
model developed in the paper yields three testable predictions that are 
supported by the data. First, the average occupation overtime premium is
 decreasing in the occupation’s nonmonetary social value. Second, 
workers self-select into jobs based on the occupation’s pro-social 
characteristics and their individual valuation of such characteristics. 
Third, there exists an inverse relationship between job satisfaction and
 overtime premiums when the job’s nonpecuniary attributes are ignored.  I
 explore the possibility that gender differences in attitudes toward 
pro-social behavior can explain some of the observed gender differences 
in overtime compensation and sorting into occupations. My results are 
consistent with the hypothesis that women place more weight on their 
occupation’s orientation toward providing help and service to others. 
Women tend to be better represented in occupations that score high on 
this social value measure, but at the same time, earn relatively lower 
overtime premiums compared to men in the same occupations. In other 
words, women are found to be more strongly drawn to “helping” 
occupations and willing to give up more in terms of overtime 
compensation without reducing their hours in exchange for higher 
occupational social value.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14491_abstract">This
 paper explores the relationship between gender differences in hours 
worked, the returns to working long hours, and the gender pay gap among 
highly educated workers. Using a cross-section of occupations, Goldin 
(2014) documents that occupations characterized by high returns to 
overwork are also those with the largest gender gap in earnings. Using 
panel data on occupations across cities over time, we show that these 
associations continue to hold even after accounting for differences 
across occupations over time, differences across cities over time, and 
differences in characteristics of occupations that vary by city. To 
provide causal evidence on the demand for long hours and how it relates 
to gender wage gaps, we exploit exogenous cross-city variation in 
low-skilled immigrant flows to proxy for changes in the prices of 
outsourcing household production. We find that low-skilled immigration 
leads to a reduction in the gender gap in weekly hours worked, as well 
as the gender pay gap, particularly in occupations that 
disproportionately reward longer hours of work. These results highlight 
the causal role of the returns to overwork in explaining the gender pay 
gap and suggest that reductions in the cost of supplying longer hours of
 work may allow women to close the gap in hours of work and to benefit 
from higher wages.  </div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14492_abstract">Using
 PSID for 1968-2011, I investigate whether and to what extent an 
increase in women’s attachment to the labor force had an effect on 
family’s ability to smooth unexpected shocks to income for continuously 
married households.  I document that although volatility of male 
earnings increased, and that of female earnings fell over this period, 
volatility of family income increased in line with previous findings. 
When computing volatility of earnings I allow for transitions in and out
 of employment, which is critical given the dramatic changes in labor 
force participation of women and recent changes for men. I decompose 
volatility of family income into its components due to volatility of: 
taxable income (labor, business, farm and rent), transfer income, and 
their covariances. I find that the covariance of spousal income shocks 
increased over time, but the share that wife’s volatility of income 
contributed to family income volatility fell and that of husband’s 
slightly increased.  I then show that the increase in family income 
variability was associated with a smaller but still significant increase
 in volatility of consumption. Households' inability to smooth 
consumption imposed a significant welfare cost. Thus, even though women 
became more attached to the labor market, and variability of their 
income fell over time, these trends were not enough to stabilize 
variability of family income. I find that liquidity constraints played a
 crucial role in propagating volatility. A dual income household is also
 a household with larger financial obligations that is more sensitive to
 income shocks. This in turn, led to a greater probability of being 
liquidity constraint and to a more variable consumption.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_14493_abstract">We
 examine changes in marriage and earnings patterns across four cohorts 
born between 1936 and 1975, using data from a series of Survey of Income
 and Program Participation panels linked to administrative data on 
earnings.  We find that for both men and women, marriage has become 
increasingly positively associated with education and earnings 
potential.  We compare ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed effect 
(FE) estimates of the earnings differential associated with marriage.  
We find that the marriage earnings gap fell for women in fixed-effect 
estimates implying that the impact of specialization has diminished over
 time.  We also find that increasingly positive selection into marriage 
overstates the reduction in the marriage earnings gap. While our 
findings imply that marriage is no longer associated with lower earnings
 among women in our most recent cohort, the motherhood gap remains 
large.  Among men, we find that the marriage premium actually increases 
for more recent birth cohorts in fixed-effects regressions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13264_abstract">This
 project will aim at understanding the causes of credit booms in low 
income countries, and the associated macroprudential policy responses. 
In low income and developing economies, credit surges are typically 
triggered by an external shock such as capital account liberalization, 
foreign aid or commodity prices. Capacity constraints in the banking 
sector and in supervisory agencies can lead to significant lowering of 
credit standards during the credit boom, which can impose large losses 
to the banking sector if a subsequent bust occurs. These costs can be 
higher if other distortions, such as the expectation of a government 
bailout, are severe. The paper will analyze the macro-prudential policy 
tools that can be used in order to stabilize credit conditions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13266_abstract">In
 this paper, we propose a framework to optimally design macroprudential 
policies in low-income countries. First, we review several case studies 
of low-income countries that have applied such policies. Then, we 
develop a DSGE model to study the implementation of macroprudential 
policies incorporating the realities that we have observed. The model 
features an economy with two agents, savers and entrepreneurs. 
Entrepreneurs are the borrowers in this economy and need capital as 
collateral to obtain loans. The macroprudential regulator uses the 
loan-to-value ratio as the policy instrument. We find that in an economy
 with frequent shocks, high uncertainty and financial exclusion, static 
macroprudential measures are preferable to time varying ones.</div>

 to social and economic research and policy. In industrialized

demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of 
“big data” exist. We show that an individual’s past history of phone use
 can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status, and that the 
predicted attributes of millions of individuals can in turn be used to 
accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation, 
or to infer the asset distribution of micro-regions comprised of just a 
few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and

social net- works, coverage, and prices, using transaction data from 
nearly the entire network of Rwandan mobile phone subscribers over 4.5 
years. Because subscribers pay on the margin, the calls placed reveal 
the value of communicating with each contact. This feature allows me to 
overcome traditional difficulties in measuring network effects, by 
estimating the utility of adopting a phone based on its eventual usage. I
 use this structural model to simulate the effects of two governmental

An adoption subsidy had a high social rate of return, and spillovers

a substantial fraction of its impact. A requirement to serve rural areas
 lowered the

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13683_abstract">In developing countries, mobile telecom networks have emerged as major
providers of financial services, bypassing the sparse retail networks of
traditional banks. We analyze a large individual-level data set of mobile
money transactions in Tanzania. Transactions can be classified as (i) money
transfers to others; (ii) short distance money self-transportation; and (iii)
money storage for short to medium periods of time. We utilize a natural
experiment of an unanticipated increase in transaction fees. We find that the
demand for long-distance transfers is less elastic than for short-distance
transfers, which suggests that mobile networks actively compete with
antiquated cash transportation systems in addition to competing with each
other. Further, we find that the willingness to pay to avoid walking with cash
an extra kilometer and to avoid storing money at home for an extra day is 1.1%
and 1% of an average transaction, respectively, which demonstrates that m-
money ameliorates significant amounts of crime-related risk. We explore the
implications of these estimates for pricing and propose Pareto superior price
discrimination.</div>

 most inequality is across rather than within states, the greatest 
potential welfare gains from social insurance are international. Few of 
these are realized at present through transfers, suggesting other 
methods of global redistribution are needed. A natural alternative is 
migration, which I estimate currently reduces global inequality by about
 a third as much as internal tax-and-transfer programs within 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries 
do. Migration to some countries, particularly the Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) monarchies, does massively more to reduce global 
inequality per person in those countries, and reasonable scenarios in 
which the OECD countries imitate GCC policies achieve much more than 
eliminating all internal inequality. Yet the GCC countries are 
stunningly unequal internally and massive abusers of human rights. Such 
examples suggest a philosophically disturbing trade-off between openness
 to global inequality-reducing migration and internal equality. For 
example, social prejudices based on national origin or authoritarian 
regimes that support a caste system could be Pareto-improving. More 
practically, regularizing past illegal migrants in exchange for sealing 
the border could be harmful.</div>

 within-country inequalities in wealth that dwarf inequalities in 
income, taxation of wealth is extremely uncommon. Piketty’s (2014) call 
for a global wealth tax has given the topic renewed attention. We 
conduct online survey experiments to study individual preferences for 
taxing wealth versus income via Mechanical Turk. Regression results 
indicate that subjects’ desired wealth tax rates are between 1 and 2 
percent, though non-parametric estimates indicate desired tax rates of 
near zero at low wealth levels. Our results indicate limited 
substitutability between wealth and income as tax bases, as desired 
income tax rates are around 15 percent, marginally lower than the 
average rate in the absence of wealth taxes. Preferred wealth tax rates 
are more than 50 percent higher when subjects are informed that the 
wealth was accumulated through inheritance. Our findings suggest that 
voter preferences are unlikely to be a barrier to wealth tax 
implementation.</div>

 are optimal taxes affected by the presence of superstar phenomena at

 the Mirrlees model to incorporate an assignment problem in the labor 
market that generates superstar effects. Perhaps surprisingly, rather 
than providing a rationale for higher taxes, we show that superstar 
effects provide a force for lower marginal taxes, conditional on the 
observed distribution of earnings. Superstar effects make the earnings 
schedule convex, which increases the responsiveness of individual 
earnings to tax changes. We show that various common elasticity measures
 are not sufficient statistics and must be adjusted upwards in optimal 
tax formulas. Finally, we study a comparative static that does not keep 
the observed earnings distribution fixed: when superstar technologies 
are introduced, inequality increases but we obtain a neutrality result, 
finding tax rates at the top unaltered.</div>

 moral reasoning is shown to differ in three specific ways from what is 
conventionally assumed in modern optimal tax theory. Large majorities of
 survey respondents resist costless redistribution of arbitrarily 
determined unequal outcomes and prefer justifying tax progressivity 
based on benefit received rather than on diminishing marginal social 
welfare of income. These attitudes are shown to be linked to widespread 
moral acceptance of unequal allocations due to luck. Together, these 
results raise the possibility that the American public views the 
allocations of taxes and pretax outcomes as morally relevant, a judgment
 that is inconsistent with conventional objectives depending solely on 
after-tax outcomes but consistent with alternative principles such as 
Classical Benefit-Based Taxation.</div>

 look at the long-run effects of war service on political preferences 
and behavior at the level of US counties. To identify a causal effect, 
we use as a source of variation the demographic profile of counties: the
 share of individuals who happened to be at peak war age around 1917 
predicts World War I service. We find that a large 1917 peak-age 
population predicts voting and campaign contribution patterns, as well 
as the behavior of elected representatives, in 21st-century elections. 
The results are consistent with a substantial degree of social 
spillovers from individual war service onto the communities where 
veterans chose to live, and indicate that individual experiences have 
long-term effects at the aggregate level.</div>

 political economy literature indicates that adverse natural shocks can 
have significant short or medium term effects on political variables. 
However, it is still unknown if the political effects of a natural shock
 can be long lasting, in the sense of persisting over centuries.  In 
this paper we focus on one of the critical elements of democracy, 
political participation.  We show that one of the best known natural 
disasters of the early modern period, the earthquake of 1693 in Sicily, 
had long lasting effects on political participation extending to current
 times.  We show that towns that were affected by the earthquake 
experienced a significant expansion of participation in city councils.  
The same towns experienced significantly more effective electoral 
reforms a century and a half later, and significantly higher electoral 
turnout two centuries and a half later. Our findings thus indicate that 
the political effects of natural disasters can be extremely long 
lasting.</div>

 investigate the historical dynamics of the decline in fertility in 
Europe and its relation to measures of cultural and ancestral distance. 
We test the hypothesis that the decline of fertility was associated with
 the diffusion of social and behavioral changes from France, in contrast
 with the spread of the Industrial Revolution, where England played a 
leading role. We argue that the diffusion of the fertility decline and 
the spread of industrialization followed different patterns because 
societies at different relative distances from the respective innovators
 (the French and the English) faced different barriers to imitation and 
adoption, and such barriers were lower for societies that were 
historically and culturally closer to the innovators. We provide a model
 of fertility choices in which the transition from higher to lower 
levels of fertility is the outcome of a process of social innovation and
 social influence, whereby late adopters observe and learn about the 
novel behaviors, norms and practices introduced by early adopters at the
 frontier. In the empirical analysis we study the determinants of 
marital fertility in a sample of European populations and regions from 
1830 to 1970, and successfully test our theoretical predictions using 
measures of genetic distance between European populations and a novel 
data set of ancestral linguistic distances between European regions.</div>

 Jones (2014) generalized division of labor (GDL) accounting of 
productivity, we extend Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2013) urban

 that high-skill workers would be less geographically concentrated

variation in fundamental amenity or excess friction is eliminated, but 
widen when productivity fundamental is equalized. We further show that 
agglomeration economies both for productivity and amenity would affect 
skill concentration and welfare inequality in the same direction (either
 more skill concentration and wider welfare gap, or less skill

 Chinese cities have invested billions of dollars in constructing new 
industrial parks.  These place based investments solve the land assembly
 problem and thus allow firms to co-locate close to each other.  The 
city mayor has strong incentives to consider the composition of the 
park’s firms with an eye on maximizing the park’s production and 
consumption spillover effects within the city.  The creation of such 
large and productive new city sub-centers that are far from the city’s 
central business district suggests that the spatial equilibrium of 
economic activities will shift when new parks are built.  Using several 
geo-coded data sets, we measure the average spillover effects of these 
parks on local incumbent firm productivity, the growth of retail 
activity close to the park and the rising quantity of new apartments 
sold and the price premium for which they sell.  We also study the 
heterogeneous effects of such parks.  Those parks with greater levels of
 human capital and co-agglomeration index, as well as lower levels of 
State Owned Enterprises participation offer greater spillover effects.</div>

 dynamics are essential to understanding differences in economic 
development over time and across countries, yet they are largely 
unexplored from a quantitative standpoint. Moreover, the rising pattern 
of investment rate is inconsistent with the predictions of most standard
 growth models. This paper examines the role of labor reallocation in 
explaining the increasingly high aggregate investment rate in China. A 
multi-sector model with non-homothetic preferences establishes the link 
between labor reallocation and the rising investment rate. It 
incorporates two facts: 1) massive labor reallocation from the 
agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector, and 2) different 
user costs of capital between state owned enterprises (SOE) and private 
owned enterprises (POE). Quantitative results generated by the 
calibrated model replicate the growth pattern in China over the past 
thirty years. Counterfactual analyses show that labor reallocation from 
the agricultural sector to the non-agricultural sector is the most 
important driver for capital accumulation, since the non-agricultural 
sector accumulates capital faster than the agricultural sector. Due to 
different user costs of capital, labor movement from SOE to POE accounts
 for a substantial part of the investment pattern after 1995.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_11803_abstract">The
 strong, positive relationship between productivity and density has been
 used as evidence for the existence of agglomeration forces such as 
productivity spillovers. This paper presents an alternative hypothesis: 
In an economic geography model where firms choose locations to be close 
to their markets, sorting endogenously generates the 
density-productivity relationship in the absence of any pecuniary or 
non-pecuniary productivity spillovers. I introduce a new solution method
 for continuous space geography models that dramatically reduces the 
complexity of the equilibrium conditions and allows such model to 
generate more predictions than was previously possible in realistic 
geographies where firms and workers choose locations. Other 
cross-sectional relationships that have traditionally been used as 
evidence of agglomeration forces can also be derived in this environment
 where no such productivity spillovers exist. This geographic model of 
sorting breaks observational equivalence between firm sorting and 
agglomeration forces and allows for an indirect test of firm sorting. 
Under specific conditions, positive shocks to density can negatively 
affect average productivity through changes in the local composition of 
firms, inconsistent with models of agglomeration forces without sorting.
 Using restricted access establishment-level Census data, I document 
strong intra-city relationships between location and firm 
characteristics predicted by the model. I use the data to test for 
evidence of composition effects, instrumenting for the supply of new 
non-residential real estate construction using the geographic 
distribution of multi-city real estate developers, and find evidence of 
firm sorting.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12627_abstract">Does
 the method of estimating plant-level productivity matter? The paper 
attempts to answer this question in the context of key stylized facts 
and popular estimation methods. Using plant-level data for the U.S., we 
test the robustness and sensitivity of results on four dimensions. 
First, we find non-trivial differences in estimated factor elasticities,
 especially for capital, across commonly used methods. These differences
 yield considerable variation in estimated returns to scale across 
methods. Second, the variation in elasticities maps into differences in 
(total factor) productivity dispersion but does not invalidate the 
general conclusion that productivity differences across establishments 
within the same industry are large. However, the quantitative 
differences in within industry dispersion are substantial and the 
ranking of plants by productivity within industries is also sensitive to
 method. Third, more productive plants are shown to be more likely to 
grow and survive, no matter how we estimate productivity. However, 
outliers in factor elasticities that arise more frequently from some 
methods non-trivially impact the quantitative marginal effects of 
productivity on growth and survival. Fourth, all our total factor 
productivity variants confirm the main conclusions from the structural 
productivity decomposition literature: reallocation is productivity 
enhancing, and variation in within-plant productivity seems more 
important in terms of cyclical fluctuations of aggregate productivity by
 all methods considered. However, here again there are non-trivial 
quantitative differences across methods in the contribution of 
reallocation to aggregate productivity growth. Some methods imply that 
all or even more than all of aggregate productivity growth is due to 
reallocation while other methods imply only 25 percent is due to 
reallocation. Finally, we find that the basic patterns are robust to the
 use of imputed plant-level data.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12628_abstract">The
 conventional wisdom in health economics is that large differences in 
average productivity across hospitals are the result of idiosyncratic, 
institutional features of the healthcare sector which dull the role of 
market forces. Strikingly, however, we find that productivity dispersion
 in heart attack treatment across hospitals is, if anything, smaller 
than in narrowly defined manufacturing industries such as ready-mixed 
concrete. While this fact admits multiple interpretations, we also find 
evidence against the conventional wisdom that the healthcare sector does
 not operate like an industry subject to standard market forces. In 
particular, we find that hospitals that are more productive at treating 
heart attacks have higher market shares at a point in time and are more 
likely to expand over time. For example, a 10 percent increase in 
hospital productivity today is associated with about 4 percent more 
patients in 5 years. Taken together, these facts suggest that the

 paper proposes to carry out a systematic assessment of measuring MFP at

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13358_abstract">A
 long tradition in economics and psychology has advanced the notion that
 individuals care about not only their own pay, but also their pay 
relative to that of their co-workers. This has potentially broad 
implications for wage structure and the organization of labor markets, 
such as the prevalence of wage compression. We use a field experiment 
with full-time Indian manufacturing workers over a one-month period to 
test whether relative pay comparisons affect effort and labor supply. 
Workers perform individual production tasks, but are organized into 
distinct teams—defined by the type of product they produce. We randomize
 teams to receive either compressed wages (where all workers earn the 
same random daily wage) or heterogeneous wages (where each team member 
is paid a different wage according to his baseline productivity level). 
This enables effort comparisons across workers who receive the same 
absolute wage, but vary in the wages of their co-workers.  We find that 
workers reduce output by 34% when their co-workers are paid more than 
themselves. They are also 20 percentage points less likely to come to 
work—giving up substantial earnings to avoid a workplace with unequal 
pay. These effects are concentrated among production tasks where it is 
more difficult to observe co-worker output. In addition, effort 
decreases are larger when the difference in baseline productivity 
between a worker and his higher-paid peers is small. These findings 
provide support for reference dependence in co-worker pay, and indicate 
that transparency about the firm’s rationale for pay is important for 
fairness perceptions and output. This may help explain why piece 
rates—which generate earnings dispersion but are transparent—are not 
perceived as unfair, while flat wages are often compressed. It also has 
implications for the types of tasks in which wage compression may be 
more likely.</div>

 analyze how quits responded to arbitrary differences in own and peer 
wages among entry- level employees using an unusual feature of a pay 
raise at a large U.S. retailer. The firm’s use of discrete pay steps 
created discontinuities in raises, where workers initially earning 
within 1 cent of each other received new wages that differed by 10 
cents. First, we use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the 
impact of a higher wage on the probability of a worker quitting within 1
 to 9 months of getting the raise. We find large causal effects of own 
wages on quits, with quit elasticities less than -10. Next, we address 
whether the overall quit response reflects the impact of comparisons to 
market wages or to in-store peer wages. Here we use a multi-dimensional 
regression discontinuity design to jointly estimate the impact of own 
and peer wages on quits. We find that the large effects of wages on 
quits mostly reflect relative pay concerns and not market comparisons. 
In fact, after accounting for peer effects, quits do not appear to be 
very sensitive to wages—consistent with significant search frictions in 
the labor market. Finally, we find that the relative pay concerns are 
asymmetric. The quit response is driven mainly by workers who are paid 
below their peers, suggesting concerns about fairness or disadvantageous
 inequity.</div>

 propose a model of job search with reference-dependent preferences, 
where the reference point is given by recent income. Newly unemployed 
individuals search hard given that they are at a loss, but over time 
they get used to lower income, and thus search less. They search harder 
again in anticipation of a benefit cut, only to ultimately get used to 
it. The model fits the typical shape of the exit from unemployment, 
including the spike at the UI exhaustion point. The model also makes 
unique predictions on the response to benefit changes. We provide 
evidence using a reform in the unemployment system in Hungary. In 
November 2005, Hungary switched from a single-step UI system to a 
two-step system, with unchanged overall generosity. We show that the 
system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and 
especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard
 time fitting, even when allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. We 
structurally estimate the model and estimate a weight on gain-loss 
utility comparable to the weight on the standard utility term, and a 
speed of adjustment of the reference point in the order of eight 
months.The results suggest that a revenue-neutral shift to multiple-step
 UI systems can speed exit from unemployment.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13561_abstract">A
 portion of the global wealth portfolio is directed towards a safe and 
liquid reserve asset, which recently has been the US Treasury bond. Our 
model links the determination of reserve asset status to relative 
fundamentals and relative debt sizes, by modeling two countries that 
issue sovereign bonds to satisfy investors’ reserve asset demands. A 
sovereign’s debt is more likely to be the reserve asset if its 
fundamentals are strong relative to other possible reserve assets, but 
not necessarily strong on an absolute basis. Debt size can enhance or 
detract from reserve asset status. If global demand for the reserve 
asset is high, a large-debt sovereign which offers a savings vehicle 
with better liquidity is more likely to be the reserve asset. If demand 
for the reserve asset is low, then large debt size is a negative as it 
carries more rollover risk, leading to a riskier vehicle for saving. 
When global demand is high, countries may make fiscal/debtstructuring 
decisions to enhance their reserve asset status. These actions have a 
tournament feature, and are self-defeating: countries may over-expand 
debt size to win the reserve asset tournament. Coordination can generate
 benefits. We use our model to study the benefits of “Eurobonds” – i.e. a
 coordinated common Europe-wide sovereign bond design. Eurobonds deliver
 welfare benefits only when they make up a sufficiently large fraction 
of countries’ debts. Small steps towards Eurobonds may hurt countries 
and not deliver welfare benefits.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13562_abstract">Recently,
 the global economy has experienced recurrent episodes of safe asset 
shortages. In this paper we present a model that shows how such 
shortages can generate macroeconomic phenomena similar to those found in
 liquidity trap scenarios. Despite the similarities, there are also 
subtle but important differences which carry significant impacts on the 
relative effectiveness of economic policy and potential market solutions
 to the underlying problem. For example, while forward guidance policies
 are typically more effective than quantitative easing ones in the 
standard liquidity trap environment, the opposite holds in safety trap 
contexts. Also, while asset bubbles (market solutions) and public debt 
are both effective in liquidity traps, only the latter are in safety 
traps. Essentially, a safe asset shortage is a deficit of a particular 
form of wealth (safe wealth), which the government has comparative 
advantage in supplying. Forward guidance and financial bubbles, which 
increase risky wealth and stimulate the economy in liquidity traps, fail
 to do so in safety traps as they are dissipated through higher spreads.</div>

 paper studies the optimal design of a coordinated pooled borrowing 
arrangement among sovereigns. We show that spillover (free-riding) 
effects effects generated by issuing joint bonds without joint 
liabilities only create second order welfare losses. If the 
non-pecuniary benefits of issuing a joint bond are larger than the 
non-pecuniary benefits of issuing bonds separately for each country, it 
is optimal for countries to pool a strictly positive fraction of their 
bonds, despite generating spillover (free-riding) effects. We develop 
formulas for the optimal level of pooling, for the optimal shares of the
 different countries in the pooled bond and for the optimal level of 
tranching. All optimal formulas depend on the sensitivity of the 
individual country price schedules to the determinants of the pooled 
bond and on the equilibrium sensitivities on the levels of borrowing by 
each country.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13459_abstract">How
 do firms respond to technological advances that facilitate the 
automation of a wide range of job tasks? Which tasks will they automate,
 and what types of worker will be replaced as a result? Recent empirical
 evidence has linked automation to job polarization: the decline in 
middle wage jobs relative to both high and low wage ones. For instance, 
advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have led to 
the replacement of workers predominantly in middle wage jobs.  
Similarly, the adoption of steam power and later electricity in US 
manufacturing was associated with a replacement of middle wage workers 
such as artisans and the growth of low wage operator and high wage 
non-production jobs. These technologies have in common that they allowed
 firms to more cheaply automate (or mechanize) tasks. However, so far 
there exists no economic model that predicts an inherent connection 
between automation and job polarization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We develop a model that analyzes how firms take advantage of a fall in 
the cost of automation. We distinguish between a task’s engineering 
complexity and its training requirements. When two tasks are equally 
complex, firms will automate the task that requires more training and in
 which labor is hence more expensive. Under quite general conditions 
this leads to job polarization. Thus, our theory explains recent and 
historical instances of job polarization as caused by labor-replacing 
technologies. In addition, the model makes novel predictions regarding 
occupational training requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In particular, the model predicts that firms have an incentive to 
automate tasks with intermediate training requirements first. We test 
this prediction at the level of occupations: using data from the 
Dictionary of Occupational Titles and the O*NET database, we show that 
from 1971-2007,  occupations that featured initially intermediate 
training requirements saw employment decline relatively, and experienced
 the largest decline in training requirements.&lt;br /&gt;</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13455_abstract">In
 the large literature on polarization in the wage and employment 
structure, arguments about shifts in relative demands for different task
 based groups have been built on comparisons of movements in employment 
and wages. In particular, increases in both wages and employment in 
cognitive task occupations relative to routine task occupations are the 
basis for arguments that Information Technology innovations are driving 
labor market polarization. But movements in average wages by occupation 
are misleading measures for determining underlying demand forces for two
 reasons. First, the workforce has undergone substantial compositional 
changes in terms of education levels, the age distribution, and the 
gender composition. Second, it seems reasonable to assume that the large
 shifts in the proportion of workers in different occupations has been 
accompanied by shifts in composition in terms of unobservable task 
related abilities. In this paper, we provide estimates of movements in 
task prices for the US for the period from 1984 to 2013. To do this, we 
adjust for changes in observable variable composition and address 
selection on unobservables through a bounding exercise. We tighten the 
bounds by appealing to the logic of standard Roy Models. In particular, 
we derive and implement the bounds associated with different versions of
 the Roy Model based on different assumptions about the joint 
distribution of abilities across sectors. We find that task prices for 
cognitive, routine and manual occupations increased strongly through the
 1990s, with some evidence of polarization, but all three declined 
strongly, and to a similar extent, after 2000.</div>

 debate about the impact of routine-biased technical change on the labor
 market revolves around the question whether employment and wages 
polarized. This paper instead shows that RBTC’s main prediction is that 
the prices paid for routine tasks should decline compared to abstract 
and manual tasks. I exploit the sorting of workers into tasks to 
estimate these price changes under relatively weak assumptions. 
Empirical results for male workers in two U.S. datasets reveal that task
 prices polarized during the 1990s and 2000s. The estimates go a long 
way in matching the change of the actual wage distribution over this 
period.

 prevailing explanation for job polarization maintains that technology 
reduces the demand for routine middle-skill employment, but there is 
limited evidence on occupational changes at the firm level. This paper 
uncovers a rich new set of facts about the way in which establishments 
are organized from a task perspective, and the establishment-level 
patterns underlying the observed changes in the employment composition 
of the economy. Using workplace-level data from the UK, we show that 
establishments tend to specialize in particular tasks, with a 
substantial fraction of their employment concentrated within one broad 
occupational category. There is considerable variation in task 
specialization across establishments within industries, in contrast with
 the recurrent assumption of homogeneity in the technology of production
 within industries. We show that occupational specialization increased 
over time, and the fraction of private sector workplaces specializing in
 non-routine tasks increased sharply between 1998 and 2011. These 
changes account for most of the changes in aggregate employment shares, 
while changes in the intensity of use of different tasks conditional on 
specialization play a relatively minor role. Establishment entry and 
exit accounts for an important fraction of the change in the 
specialization composition of establishments. We also document a large 
increase in the use of computers in non-routine manual workplaces and 
find no support for the hypothesis that the adoption of new technologies
 is associated with a lower propensity to increase employment. </div>

 paper reports on the measures that were taken at the European Patent

 the European patent litigation systems and their development since

being implemented. Reforms introduced at the EPO in 2007 and subsequent 
years led to a marked decrease in the grant rate, a reduction in claims

examiners’ search reports. I report evidence that patent examination at 
the EPO is still more stringent than at the US Patent and Trademark 
Office. Litigation activity in Europe increased since 2007, with a focus
 on German courts, but is still at relatively low levels when compared 
to the U.S. system. The substantial reduction of patenting costs in 
Europe in the wake of the introduction of a Unified Patent with

 patent holder whose patent has been infringed has two basic remedies 
available: monetary damages and a court-ordered injunction requiring the
 infringing party to cease its infringement.  In the United States until
 2006, damages typically provided compensation for past infringement 
while injunctions prevented future infringement.  But that all changed 
with the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in the eBay case, which 
significantly reduced the use of injunctions.  Since eBay, when patent 
holders seek permanent injunctions, the courts have granted over 80% of 
their requests in cases where the infringer competes against the patent 
holder, but only about 20% in cases where the infringer and the patent 
holder are not competitors.  As a result, the U.S. patent system is now 
very much a hybrid system, mixing property rules and liability rules.  
This article explores the incentives for invention and for technology 
adoption in such a hybrid system.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12787_abstract">Vertical
 rebates, paid from a manufacturer to a retailer for meeting a set of 
conditions, are prominently used across a wide range of industries. 
These contracts may be used to induce greater retailer effort, but may 
also prompt a retailer to drop competing products in order to attain the
 rebate payment. We study these offsetting efficiency and foreclosure 
effects empirically, using detailed data on the sales and rebate 
payments of a retailer in the confections industry. We show how the 
rebate allocates the cost of effort between the manufacturer and 
retailer, and estimate structural models of demand and retailer behavior
 to quantify the efficiency gains induced by the rebate.
We find that the rebate increases industry profitability and consumer 
surplus, but that it fails to implement the product assortment that 
maximizes social surplus, and results in upstream foreclosure. The 
welfare effects of the rebate depend on what the rebating firm does when
 rebates are disallowed, and we compare social welfare under the rebate 
to alternatives in which the manufacturer re-optimizes her wholesale 
price or merges with an upstream competitor.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_12790_abstract">Evaluating
 the effects of mergers is especially challenging in industries where 
intermediate prices are negotiated between upstream and downstream 
players. A key issue that remains elusive to researchers is the 
mechanism through which mergers affect negotiated prices within the 
context of a bargaining model. Two main effects are at play: A 
bargaining leverage effect (changes in outside options or disagreement 
payoffs) and a bargaining power effect (the merged firm may have 
different bargaining skills from those of the merging firms). In this 
paper we empirically identify the role played by bargaining power 
vis-à-vis bargaining leverage following an upstream merger.  
To do so, we make use of a unique dataset from the bottled water 
industry in Chile. Two features of this dataset allow us to disentangle 
the different effects of the merger. First, we observe both retail 
quantity and prices for bottled water at the store, brand and week 
level, as well as the wholesale prices at which upstream suppliers sell 
the water to the firms. Second, we have data before and after an 
important merger occurred in this sector where the third largest bottled
 water firm was acquired by the second largest firm, the Coca-Cola 
Company. We analyze the bottled water market through the lens of a 
structural model of the interactions between suppliers, supermarkets and
 final consumers. The model features two stages. In stage one, suppliers
 choose the retail prices that maximize the channel surplus. In the 
second stage, suppliers and supermarkets bargain over wholesale prices 
in bilateral negotiations which determine the way the channel surplus is
 shared among the players. Taking the model to the data we are able to 
back out marginal costs and to identify changes in bargaining power and 
bargaining leverage before and after the merger.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20015_abstract">In
 "advance refundings," a widespread practice where existing callable 
debt is
defeased by issuing new bonds, issuers lose by pre-committing to call. 
The average option value lost is 1% of par value, not including fees. 
This translates to an aggregate value lost of over $7 billion from 1995 
to 2013 for the bonds in our sample, which are roughly two-thirds of all
 advance refunded bonds. A motivation for the transaction is that it 
enables issuers to borrow, in a non-transparent way, to fund current 
operating activities in exchange for future higher interest payments.  
Municipalities in states with more corruption destroy more option value.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_20163_abstract">Inventory
 models of dealership markets following Ho and Stoll (1981) imply that 
intermediaries rely on pricing policies to reduce their exposure to 
inventory risk, i.e., the risk of unfavorable price movements in the 
assets on their inventories. Consequently, extreme inventory positions 
of intermediaries affect market prices, and thus, subsequent returns. We
 study dealer inventory positions in the US corporate bond market over 
the time period from 2003 to 2013 based on a complete set of 
transactions data. In particular, we examine asset pricing implications 
of inventory models by relating the cross-section of dealer inventories 
to bond returns. We find strong support for the implications of 
inventory models. A long-short quintile portfolio based on dealers' 
inventory positions yields significant positive risk-adjusted returns of
 18 bp per week. The results are robust to different sample periods, 
i.e., full, pre-crisis, and crisis period.</div>

independent of the assets purchased, and runs through a reserve-induced 
portfolio balance channel. For evidence we analyze the reaction of Swiss
 long-term government bond yields to announcements by the Swiss National
 Bank to expand central bank reserves without acquiring any long-lived

state vector. We apply the model to the term structure of US Treasury 
rates, estimated at the daily frequency, allowing for jumps on days of 
employment report announcements.  Our model can match the empirical fact
 that the term structure of interest rate volatility has a hump-shaped 
pattern on employment report days (but not on other days). The model 
also produces patterns in bond risk premia that are consistent with the 
empirical finding that much of the time-variation in excess bond returns
 accrues at times of important macroeconomic data releases.</div>

 theoretically study how commodity financialization affects trading 
behavior, prices and welfare through affecting risk sharing and price 
discovery in futures markets. In our model, the general equilibrium 
feature makes financial traders either provide or demand liquidity in 
the futures market, depending on the information environment. Consistent
 with recent evidence, commodity financialization reduces the futures 
price bias through broadening risk sharing and injecting information 
into the market. Each financial trader loses and final-end commodity 
consumers benefit in the process of commodity financialization. 
Commercial hedgers can either lose or win, and their welfare improves 
with commodity financialization only when the number of active financial
 traders takes intermediate values.</div>

over return states are reflected in belief dispersion in options and

 analyze whether introduction of Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) on a 
borrowers' debt leads to lender moral hazard around covenant violations,
 wherein lending banks can terminate or accelerate the bank loan. Using a
 regression discontinuity design, we show that CDS firms, even those 
that are more prone to agency issues, do not decrease their investment 
after a covenant violation. But, CDS firms pay a significantly higher 
spread on loans issued after covenant violations and perform poorly when
 compared with non-CDS firms that violate covenants. These results are 
magnified when lenders have weaker incentives to monitor (higher 
purchase of credit derivatives, higher amount of securitization and 
higher non-interest income). However, conditional on a covenant 
violation, CDS firms do not become distressed or go bankrupt at a higher
 rate than firms without CDS. Our results suggest that introduction of 
CDS misaligns incentives between lenders and borrowers but doesn't lead 
to a severe empty creditor problem in the private debt market.</div>

 do fire sales happen for financial assets, even when there are 
well-capitalized investors somewhere in the economy? We propose a theory
 of financial fire sales based on a noisy rational expectations 
equilibrium framework with endogenous adverse selection. When informed 
market participants are liquidity-constrained due to market-wide shocks,
 prices become less informative. This creates an adverse selection 
problem, decreasing the supply of high-quality assets. This "lemons" 
problem makes well-capitalized uninformed market participants unwilling 
to absorb the supply, thereby freezing the market. Our results shed 
light on the paradoxical nature of fire sales in which capital seems to

 develop an incomplete markets framework to show that international risk
 sharing can be low, particularly among countries with large 
interest-rate differentials. Furthermore, risk sharing computed from 
asset returns can be consistent with that computed from consumption.
The fundamental departure in our paper is that exchange rate growth need
 not equal the ratio of stochastic discount factors (SDFs), and we 
develop a
restriction that precludes ``good deals" in international economies with
 incomplete markets. Our innovation is to compute the lowest risk 
sharing consistent with SDFs that (i) are nonnegative, (ii) correctly 
price returns, and (iii) disallow ``good deals."</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21014_abstract">This
 paper examines, empirically and theoretically, whether accounting for 
limited stock market participation can help explain international 
consumption risk sharing and asset prices. Empirically, for stock 
markets that are integrated with the U.S. market (such as European 
markets), U.S. stockholders' long-run consumption growth can explain the
 equity market index returns, as well as the within-market cross-section
 of equity returns. In contrast, there is little explanatory power for 
the asset returns of markets segmented from the U.S. market (such as 
Japanese and other Asia-Pacific markets). Consistent with these results,
 I present new evidence, employing micro-level household consumption 
data in the U.S. and U.K., showing that stockholders' consumption 
correlation is considerably higher than that of the aggregate 
consumption growth. I construct an incomplete market model that features
 limited stock market participation in each country. Besides matching 
the salient features of asset prices, the model quantitatively 
rationalizes the above empirical results, as well as explains the 
international equity premium puzzle (low aggregate consumption 
correlation and high asset return correlation). The model demonstrates 
that financial integration can generate excess comovement of asset 
prices relative to comovement in aggregate fundamentals, as in data. I 
study the welfare implications of a financial integration, and find that
 the benefits are all captured by the stockholders.</div>

underweighting of stocks from countries that are far from home 
geographically, economically, culturally, or informationally). In fact, 
the two biases may not be distinct at all. We characterize a measure of 
“pure” home bias as the amount by which home bias exceeds the level that
 would be predicted for a foreign country with zero “distance”. We 
establish that there is no pure bias in 24 developed markets. In 4 
countries there is negative pure bias explained by the fact that they 
are tax havens. There is positive and large pure bias in 13 younger 
markets. . We identify country characteristics that are correlated with 
the degree of pure home bias. These are mainly development and

 examine the patterns and determinants of external portfolio equity 
allocations of emerging&lt;br /&gt;
market economies. Using both aggregate data on bilateral asset holdings

strong evidence of a foreign allocation bias in the composition of

 in the recipient country, who then tend to invest preferentially in the
 source country. This effect is stronger for emerging market investors,

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21241_abstract">We
 provide a theory of activist investors as brokers of takeovers where 
bidders and activists are equally subject to a dual free-rider problem: 
Neither do shareholders sell their shares unless the price fully 
reflects the anticipated value improvement of the intervention nor do 
those who retain their shares contribute to the intervention costs. We 
show that activism and tender offers represent opposite approaches to 
this dual problem and derive several sets of results. First, activism 
can better harness the bidder’s ability to improve target value because 
it is transitory and because working for control becomes more attractive
 but paying for control more expensive when potential improvements are 
larger. Second, activism is Pareto-improving and deepens the market for 
corporate control along the extensive margin (takeover probability) and 
the intensive margin (ownership consolidation), raising overall takeover
 activity but reducing tender offers. Third, pre-campaign coordination 
on toeholds can mitigate inefficiencies that arise from the limited 
scope for explicit contracting between bidders and activists. Last, 
empty voting improves the activists’ incentives and ultimately helps to 
consolidate ownership in the hands of bidders.</div>

 is it better to sell assets separately versus pooling them together? We
 study this issue in a setting where the number of potential buyers for 
an asset is endogenous and is a function not just of the costs

other possible buyers. We show that if buyers anticipate that there may 
be another buyer who in expectation has a higher value for the target, 
they will be less likely to enter since they anticipate being less 
likely to win, and having to pay a higher price when they do win. This 
reduces competition and lowers revenue for the seller of the asset. This
 reduction in competition, however, is different depending on how the 
assets are sold and is attenuated when assets are sold together relative
 to when they are sold separately. We characterize when this competitive
 effect leads the seller to prefer to sell the assets together rather

 a direct estimate of income diversion for 156 firms from 1999 through 
2004, we show that an increase in tax enforcement following the election
 of Vladimir Putin in 2000 is associated with a decrease in the 
appropriation of private rents by insiders in those firms investigated 
for tax evasion. We also find evidence consistent with a simultaneous 
spillover effect: the largest non-government controlled companies in 
Russia decrease income diversion  even though they were not explicitly 
targeted as tax evaders. This effect is significant both economically 
and statistically after controlling for changes in firm-level corporate 
governance and it cannot be explained by trends in the general 
improvement of corporate governance in Russia during our sample period. 
Finally, we find no significant evidence of either substitution or 
complementarity between firms’ corporate governance and government’s tax
 enforcement vis-à-vis income diversion. </div>

document four results: First, increased transparency through the signing
 of Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) between home countries 
and tax havens increases average shareholder value of affected firms by 
2.5 percent. Second, the positive effect is stronger for firms with more
 complex firm structures within tax havens. Third, one third of firms 
respond to TIEAs by engaging in haven hopping, i.e., moving their 
subsidiaries from tax havens that entered TIEAs to tax havens that did 
not; TIEAs did not impact average shareholder value for such haven 
hoppers. Fourth, the positive shareholder effect of increased 
transparency is larger for firms with lower institutional ownership.

 saving and (ii) increased transparency is applauded by non-controlling

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13771_abstract">School
 reforms in our country have historically been made with no 
consideration of the communities that are served by each given school. 
However, school reforms could have important implications for 
surrounding communities as households place great weight on school 
quality and take schools into account when making residential choices. 
How households respond to school reforms can therefore hold important 
implications for the future of the neighborhood. No Child Left Behind 
(NCLB), our current large scale school reform, is no exception. 
Notifying parents that their local school is failing to meet Adequate 
Yearly Progress (AYP) could lead households with resources in a poor 
neighborhood to leave, creating further decline in a neighborhood where 
many households are already disadvantaged. On the other hand, the 
additional resources that a school receives, or the choice provisions 
that result from failing to meet AYP could attract households to enter 
these neighborhoods. This paper will fill the gap in our knowledge of 
how school reforms shape neighborhoods, focusing specifically on the 
effects of NCLB. I begin by identifying all the schools across the 
country that failed to meet AYP targets and describing the communities 
surrounding these
schools. I then identify how these reforms have affected neighborhoods 
in five diverse urban school districts: New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, 
Philadelphia and Tucson. I examine whether housing demand and 
neighborhood composition change as a result of this failure.</div>

1950s; The population has suburbanized and the poor now live closer to the city
center. The recent research by urban economists finds that the income elasticity of
land demand is too low to explain the poor's urbanization, which mainly comes from
better access to public transportation in cities. We take the new findings seriously
and develop a new hybrid Tiebout-Alonso model by explicitly introducing (i) a
public transportation as an alternative mode of commute to automobile, and (ii) a
housing production function that allows us to work with the income elasticity of land
demand directly. We later extend the model in several other directions, including
an extended model with a decentralized employment centers. Our model finds that
the neighborhood amenities (i.e education and property taxes) have substantial effect
on the residential patterns across metropolitan areas that cannot be ignored, and
produces some testable predictions.

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13773_abstract">Historically,
 housing and education have been inextricably linked in the United 
States, with access to high quality schools often limited to middle and 
upper income families while poor children and households are “stuck” 
living in poor neighborhoods with low quality schools. Housing subsidies
 potentially play an important role in addressing this inequality. 
Specifically, the Housing Choice Voucher program, which allows 
low-income families to choose and lease units in neighborhoods they 
otherwise might not be able to afford, currently serves over 2 million 
households, and over 2.5 million children under the age of eighteen. In 
this paper we seek to shed light on whether – and to what extent -- this
 large national program improves educational outcomes for children whose
 families receive housing vouchers. Using data on the largest school 
district in the country, New York City, we match over 88,000 voucher 
families to public school records and follow their schooling and 
residential experiences. To identify the causal effects of vouchers, we 
use a difference-in-differences strategy, exploiting the random timing 
of voucher receipt to compare changes in outcomes of students whose 
families receive a housing voucher to changes in outcomes of students 
whose families will receive one in the future. We then compare changes 
in outcomes among children whose families receive vouchers to changes 
among children whose families receive other forms of housing assistance,
 specifically those who live in public housing. Preliminary results 
suggest that students in voucher households perform slightly better in 
both ELA and math in the years that they are in the program. We also 
find that students in voucher households perform better than their peers
 in public housing, suggesting that portable subsidies, such as 
vouchers, may be more effective at improving outcomes for children than 
place-based subsidies such as public housing.</div>

 for other potential determinants: housing characteristics, demographic 
traits, average proficiency average proficiency test scores, and 
neighborhood effects. The results indicate that NCLB ratings have a 
positive impact on housing prices. Depending on the year, we find that  
buyers paid more for homes zoned with high schools that achieved a 
positive rating, reaching a high of 7.1 percent. . Nevertheless, NCLB 
has been criticized as sending a misleading signal to the public about

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13852_abstract">We
 provide new evidence of cyclical variation in mortgage default option 
exercise. For a given level of negative equity, borrower propensity to 
default rose markedly during the financial crisis and among hard-hit 
metropolitan areas. Shifts in borrower default propensity were material 
to the crisis: results show that changes in borrower sensitivity to 
negative equity were more salient to crisis-period defaults than were 
adverse shocks to home equity. Analysis of time-series and panel data 
indicates that local economic conditions, consumer sentiment, and 
federal foreclosure mitigation programs explain much of the rise in the 
negative equity beta. Difference-in-difference tests further corroborate
 unintended consequences of the Home Affordable Modification Program 
(HAMP) in boosting borrower propensity to default in the presence of 
negative equity.</div>

 stock and real estate investments are known to be locally biased. We 
establish that households residing in a Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(MSA) with few publicly traded firms headquartered there are more likely

However, MSAs with few firms might simply have more unsophisticated 
investors, who are familiar with homes as opposed to stocks. Indeed, 
households living in low FICO (subprime) zip codes, controlling for 
wealth and income, are more likely to invest in homes than stocks than 
households living in high FICO zip codes in the same MSA. But, this 
difference is smaller for MSAs with few firms, consistent with our

 mortgages in the United States are securitized in agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and thus the yield spreads on these 
securities are a key determinant of homeowners’ funding costs. We study 
the variation in these spreads, over time and across securities, and 
document that they display a cross-sectional smile pattern with respect 
to the securities’ coupon rates. We propose non-interest-rate prepayment
 risk as a candidate driver of the spread variation and present a new 
pricing model that uses "stripped" MBS prices to identify the 
contribution of this risk. The pricing model finds the smile to be 
explained by prepayment risk, while the time-series variation is mostly 
accounted for by a non-prepayment risk factor that co-moves with MBS 
supply and credit risk in other fixed-income markets. We then study the 
MBS market’s response to the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases and use 
the pricing model to interpret the post-announcement divergence of

that perceived house price growth rates are strongly linked to

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13987_abstract">The
 literature analyzing the FDI effects on host economies chiefly explores
 horizontal and vertical directions. A horizontal level represents 
interactions among the FDI and its local competitors. A vertical level 
represents interactions of the FDI with its suppliers or customers and 
can be further divided into upstream and downstream interactions. For 
both directions of effects the literature recognizes two main channels 
of interactions between the FDI and other firms in the economy. One 
channel involves changes in market structure: increase of competition on
 horizontal level is potentially off-set by higher demand for 
intermediate goods on the vertical level. Second channel involves 
technological spillovers in the form of the technology transfers from 
the FDI that positively affect local firms. In connection to the above, 
simple theoretical models consider variants of three different 
scenarios: i) the goods on the domestic market are produced by domestic 
firms, ii) the goods are produced by FDI operating in the domestic 
market and iii) the goods are imported from abroad. While theoretical 
models conclude that second and third scenarios increase competition 
within industry and could crowd out the local firms, the empirical 
results suggest that the overall effect strongly depends on the exports 
of the FDI firm, as well as the interactions of the FDI with the local 
suppliers (horizontal level effects). We consider the FDI production 
combined with traded output and analyze interactions at horizontal and 
vertical levels, including exports from the local economy. For our 
analysis we employ double-digit industry-sector data from the Amadeus 
database to cover the firm level activity in the European Union 
countries. We further link data on firm, sector and type of the goods 
produced with the BACI database covering the detailed exchange of goods 
between countries. Based on the availability of the ownership structure 
data we cover period 2000-2012.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13988_abstract">Using
 the detailed Russian customs data for 2010-2013, we study how the 
country’s entrance to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012 
influenced the composition of goods declared for imports. We hypothesize
 that the decrease and harmonization of import tariffs that followed the
 WTO entrance resulted not only in the increase of the volume of imports
 but also changed the composition of goods declared for imports. Our 
data contains over 10 million observations of custom declarations of 
goods imported into Russia during each year of our sample where all 
goods are classified according to the refined 10-digits coding system. 
This enables us to calculate an index that characterizes the complexity 
of imports at the international 4-digits products categorization. We 
compare these indices for each 4-digits category of products in the 
periods before and after the WTO entrance and find that the complexity 
of imported goods significantly increased after the event. We motivate 
our further analysis by the results of the annual survey of retailers 
conducted by RosBusinessConsulting which finds that the composition of 
goods that are officially declared as imports to Russia and the 
composition of imported goods sold by retailers significantly differs 
each year. This survey also finds that within the same product category 
goods that are sold by retailers tend to be more sophisticated than 
goods that they declare for imports. This evidence suggests that in high
 and differential tariff environment that characterized Russia prior to 
the WTO entrance importers had an incentive to misclassify the imported 
goods and declare them as simple products in order to pay lower tariffs.
 Being able to identify importing firms and composition of goods they 
declare for imports before and after the event we study how the import 
tariffs harmonization decreases the importers’ incentive of such product
 misclassification.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13989_abstract">The
 economic convergence vis-à-vis the EU member states remains an 
important goal for Romania in long term. This relies in part on 
international trade. International trade specialization reflects 
differences in relative factor productivity and endowments or economies 
of scale and can have an important impact on economic growth.&lt;br 
/&gt;
The analysis of Romanian trade with EU countries shows that exports and 
imports have increased in the sector of electrical machinery and dropped
 in the traditional sector of manufactured articles. This could be 
interpreted as development of intraindustry trade. However, the 
increasing trade seems to be caused in large parts by increasing 
exchanges of parts and components between countries as a consequence of 
international fragmentation of production.&lt;br /&gt;
In this paper, we analyze the trade specialization of Romania vis-à-vis 
EU member states over the period 1990-2014. Specifically, we focus on 
whether there is a shift towards intraindustry trade leading to economic
 convergence. Besides, we try to explain the trade pattern taking also 
into consideration the theory of production fragmentation. Our empirical
 analysis is based on economic indicators and the econometric estimation
 of a gravity model.&lt;br /&gt;
The results underline that Romania is going from an inter-industry 
specialization (with traditional products) to a vertical intra-industry 
specialization. The analysis of trade of intermediate goods highlights 
the main determinant which explains the fragmentation of production 
process, more precisely the cheap labor factor. In other words, Romania 
has followed the strategy of exploiting their comparative advantage of 
low labor costs in the context of the international division of 
production processes.</div>

 decades have experienced a marked acceleration in the process of 
globalization. This remarkable proliferation of the globalization 
phenomenon has been associated with significant consequences felt in 
economic, social and political well-being around the globe. This paper 
analyzes the role of economic globalization in improving different 
governance issues that are of particularly important in the context of 
developing nations. We contribute to this literature by exploring how 
does economic globalization comprising of different aspects of 
internationalization like trade openness, FDI inflows, and portfolio 
investments affect different dimensions of governance? Further, while a 
large part of globalization implies greater trade and FDI inflows, it 
also implies integration of culture, ideas and vision. In this context, 
we delve into the role of a different aspect of globalization where 
emergence of neo transnational capital played a pivotal role in changing
 different and varied social mindsets across the world into a more 
cosmopolitan one (social globalization). In particular we analyze if 
social globalization acts as a moderator in the relationship between 
economic globalization and governance. Our contributions in the paper 
are twofold. First our results show that economic globalization enhances
 most indicators of governance like rule of law, government 
effectiveness, reducing corruption, regulatory quality and voice and 
accountability. Second, our results importantly show that indeed social 
globalization acts as a moderator. The estimated marginal impacts show 
that countries with low levels of social globalization, fail to benefit 
from economic globalization. Yet, this impact is enhanced for countries 
with higher levels of social globalization.</div>

 conventional analysis of policy-induced changes in resource extraction 
is inconsistent with the actual way OPEC is exerting its market power. 
We claim that OPEC is practicing limit pricing, and we extend to 
non-renewable resources the limit-pricing theory. Facing a very 
inelastic demand, an oil extractive cartel seeks to induce the highest 
price that does not destroy its demand, unlike the conventional 
Hotellian analysis: the cartel tolerates some ordinary substitutes to 
its oil but deters high-potential ones. With limit pricing, 
policy-induced extraction changes do not obey the usual logic.
For example, oil taxes have no effect on current oil production. 
Extraction increases when high-potential substitutes are promoted, but 
can be effectively reduced by supporting ordinary substitutes.
The carbon tax not only applies to oil; it also penalizes its ordinary 
(carbon) substitutes, whose market shares are taken over by the cartel. 
Thus the carbon tax ambiguously affects current and long-term oil 
production and carbon emissions.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_13947_abstract">Regional
 policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gases are often thought to be 
less effective than more geographically comprehensive policies as 
production and emissions of trade exposed industries may move from 
regulated to unregulated regions. This so-called leakage may negate 
emission reductions from the regulated regions and may even lead to an 
overall increase in emissions if the unregulated regions has more 
emissions intensive production (Carbone and Rivers (2014) review 
international leakage effects and Bushnell and Chen (2012) and Bushnell 
et al. (2014) document examples of sub-national leakage). However, if 
the unregulated regions have less emissions intensive production, the 
regional regulation may prompt more switching to the relatively cleaner 
producers than would otherwise occur, creating a type of beneficial 
leakage. We use detailed electricity generation and transmission data to
 show that this might be the case for the Regional Greenhouse Gas 
Initiative (RGGI), a CO2 cap-and-trade program for the electricity 
sector in select Northeastern U.S. states. Using 
difference-in-differences and event study methodologies with 
nonparametric price controls, we find evidence that RGGI induced 
coal-fired generators in RGGI-states to reduce capacity utilization by 
around ten percentage points, while natural gas (NG)-fired plants 
utilization rates remained constant. At the same time, after controlling
 for load, fuel prices and other regulatory issues, we find evidence 
that RGGI induced NG-fired generators in states surrounding RGGI to 
increase utilization rates by around eleven percentage points, though 
production from coal-fired plants in these surrounding regions remained 
constant. Thus, it appears that cleaner NG-fired generation from 
surrounding regions supplanted coal-fired generation in RGGI. Analysis 
of transmission flows to RGGI regions and other surrounding areas from 
PJM further support this assertion. Back-of-the-envelope calculations 
suggest that one-quarter to one-third of apparent emissions reductions 
actually leaked but that this served to reduce total combined emissions 
by an additional three to five percent.</div>

 the Great Contraction, regions of the United States that experienced 
the largest declines in household debt to income also experienced the 
largest drops in consumption and employment. We develop a search and 
matching model that reproduces such patterns. Tighter debt constraints 
raise workers' and firms' discount rates, thus reducing match surplus, 
vacancy creation and employment. Two ingredients of our model, 
on-the-job human capital accumulation and worker debt constraints 
greatly amplify the drop in employment. On-the-job human capital 
accumulation implies that the returns to posting a vacancy are 
backloaded: the surplus from a match is then more sensitive to changes 
in firm discount rates. Worker debt constraints amplify these effects 
further by preventing wages from falling too much. We show that the 
model reproduces the salient cross-sectional features of the U.S. data, 
including the comovement between consumption, house prices,

cost of using high-powered incentive plans with a substantial 
discretionary component. To provide near-efficient incentives to the 
agent and to mitigate doubts about the principal's motive, the principal
 either adopts carefully designed rigid policies such as efficiency

 should a firm set policies--public decision plans that determine the

several agents with unrestricted vertical transfers and symmetric 
information. We show that if relationships are bilateral--each agent 
observes only his own output and payoff then the principal may optimally
 make decisions in a systematically backward-looking, history-dependent 
way in order to credibly reward agents who performed well in the past. 
We first show that these backward-looking policies are prevalent in a 
broad class of settings. Then we show by example how such policies might
 affect firm performance: for example, hiring might lag increases in 
demand or investment might be awarded in a biased tournament. In 
contrast to the game with bilateral relationships, we show that if 
monitoring is public, optimal policies never involve biased decisions.</div>

 paper proposes a nonparametric estimation method for conditional

 at unknown locations but are otherwise smooth. Estimators of the jump

The proposed jump location estimator is robust to outliers and avoids 
the mis-specification problems that are present in parametric estimation
 techniques while maintaining the parametric convergence rate. I provide
 the limiting distribution of the discontinuous jump locations and their
 sizes. I also show that there is possible efficiency gain from a joint 
analysis of multiple quantiles. I subsequently apply this method to the 
estimation of a ``tipping point'' in dynamic demographic change and show
 a discontinuous effect of the minority share in a city on the

 consider a regression discontinuity (RD) design where the treatment is 
received if a score is above a cutoff, but the cutoff may vary for each 
unit in the sample instead of being equal for all units. This 
Multi-Cutoff Regression Discontinuity Design is very common in empirical
 work, and researchers often normalize the score variable and use the 
zero cutoff on the normalized score for all observations to estimate a 
pooled RD treatment effect. We formally derive the form that this pooled
 parameter takes, and discuss its interpretation under different

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21707_abstract">In
 recent years, numerous studies have employed regression discontinuity 
designs with many cutoffs assigning individuals to heterogeneous 
treatments. A common practice is to normalize all of the cutoffs to zero
 and estimate only one effect. This procedure identifies the average of 
local treatment effects weighted by the observed relative density of 
individuals at the existing cutoffs. However, researchers often want to 
make inferences on more meaningful average treatment effects (ATE) 
computed over general counterfactual distributions of individuals rather
 than simply the observed distribution of individuals local to existing 
cutoffs. In this paper, we propose a root-n consistent and 
asymptotically normal estimator for such ATEs when heterogeneity follows
 a non-parametric smooth function of cutoff characteristics. In the case
 of parametric heterogeneity, observations are optimally combined to 
minimize the mean squared error of the ATE estimator. Inference results 
are also provided for the fuzzy regression discontinuity case, where the
 parametric heterogeneity assumption yields identification of treatment 
effects on individuals who comply with at least one of the multiple 
treatments.</div>

 paper proposes a new strategy for the identification of all the

heterogeneity of the “first stage” in covariates that are separable from
 the endogenous variables of interest. The covariates themselves may be 
endogenous, and their endogeneity does not need to be modeled. With some
 modifications, the identification strategy is extended to the 
Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Ours is the first paper to obtain
 identification of nonparametric marginal effects in an RDD setting. 
This paper also provides parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric 
Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimators which are simple to implement,
 discusses their asymptotic properties, and shows that the estimators

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21909_abstract">Despite
 massive large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by central banks around the
 world since the global financial crisis, there is a lack of empirical 
evidence on whether and how the composition of purchased assets matters.
 Using rich mortgage-market data, we document that there is a “flypaper 
effect” of LSAPs, where the transmission of unconventional monetary 
policy to interest rates and (more importantly) origination volumes 
depends crucially on the nature of the assets purchased. For example, 
QE1, which involved significant purchases of GSE-guaranteed mortgages, 
increased GSE-guaranteed mortgage originations significantly more than 
the origination of non-GSE mortgages. In contrast, QE2’s focus on 
purchasing Treasuries did not have such differential effects. Moreover, 
we find that most bank proceeds from LSAPs remained in Excess Reserves 
with the Fed, with little evidence supporting the bank-lending channel 
transmission mechanism of LSAPs. The targeted nature of the Fed’s RMBS 
purchasing program thus de facto allocated credit across mortgage market
 segments and more broadly across fixed-income markets. This led to an 
unintended consequence of the program: many borrowers delevered to take 
advantage of QE-induced low interest rates by refinancing existing 
mortgages into GSE-eligible loans that were below local Conforming Loan 
Limits and below 80% LTV. Finally, we show that HARP significantly 
alleviated this behavior, suggesting that complementary interventions 
enhanced the strength of Quantitative Easing on the real economy.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21855_abstract">We
 investigate the relationship between seasonal migration and informal 
risk sharing in rural Bangladesh. We use data from a randomized 
controlled trial which provided incentives for households to migrate 
(Bryan et al., 2014). Using this experimental variation, we first 
provide evidence of the effect of decreasing migration costs on 
endogenous risk sharing in the village. We then investigate the 
mechanisms of this effect. We undertake a semi-parametric analysis of 
the source of income shocks, source of insurance and measurement error. 
Next, we characterize a dynamic model of migration and endogenous risk 
sharing, incorporating investment in learning about migration 
possibilities. Estimation of the model is in progress; we plan to 
analyze the welfare effect of alternative policies to encourage 
migration, such as access to credit and further reductions in the cost 
of migrating.</div>

 paper uses new tracking surveys for several developing countries to 
analyze rural-urban migration and their macroeconomic implications. We 
document that migrants from rural to urban areas typically experience 
large consumption growth one year after migrating, though overall 
migration rates are low. To understand these facts we build a model that
 generates a rural-urban gap in average consumption due to three 
factors: income risk from migration, worker sorting, and disutility from
 migration. We structurally estimate the model and assess the relative 
importance of each factor in explaining rural-urban consumption gaps. We
 then cross-check the model’s predictions using evidence from a 
controlled migration experiment. Quantitative experiments using the 
model provide guidance about the quantitative importance of migration 
policy on aggregate consumption growth.</div>

 provide an explanation for large spatial wage disparities and low male

consumption-smoothing, provided by caste-based rural insurance networks,
 and the income-gains from migration. Our theory generates two key 
predictions, which we verify empirically: (i) relatively wealthy 
households within the caste who benet less from the redistributive 
(surplus-maximizing) network will be more likely to have migrant 
members, and (ii) households facing greater rural income-risk (who benet
 more from the insurance network) are less likely to have migrant

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21858_abstract">We
 study rural and urban lifecycle consumption, i.e., macro- and 
micro-nutrient intake, and expenditures in four African countries. We 
find higher and steeper lifecycle profiles for expenditures and 
consumption risk -- i.e., unanticipated changes in consumption -- in 
urban areas than in rural areas. This implies a potential substantial 
loss of relative consumption insurance over the life cycle in urban 
areas compared with rural areas. We propose a structural transformation 
model with heterogeneous agents, rural-urban migration, and endogenous 
skill acquisition choices that explicitly depend on the expected 
consumption/expenditures and its risk in each residential area. The 
model aims at replicating the lifecycle profiles (mean and variance) of 
consumption and income in rural and urban areas, and the transmission 
from income to consumption in each area. To do so, we entertain the 
possibility of two separate borrowing constraints, one associated with 
consumption and one with inputs for production. Further, in rural areas 
we introduce a tax/subsidy scheme that enhances consumption insurance 
but imposes saving constraints on rural households. Our preliminary 
quantitative assessment shows that the rural-urban differences in 
consumption insurance can drop the welfare gains from both 
rural-to-urban migration and skill acquisition by roughly 50% if 
measured in expenditures units and to more than 80% in consumption units
 (i.e., nutrients). Migrant selection potentially implies substantial 
differences in welfare gains (along the transition path) from changing 
the tax/subsidy scheme that preserves insurance in rural areas. Our 
preliminary results suggest that the relatively worse risk-sharing 
arrangements in urban areas compared with rural, in particular those 
that preserve subsistence nutrient intake, build an insurance trap that 
deters migration and skill acquisition for African economies.</div>

 present a methodology for estimating the distributional effects of an 
endogenous treatment that varies at the group level when there are 
group-level unobservables, a quantile extension of Hausman and Taylor 
(1981). Because of the presence of group-level unobservables, standard 
quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if 
the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our 
estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, 
consisting of group-by-group quantile regression followed by two-stage 
least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, 
we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations 
per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero-mean 
normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor (1981), micro-level
 covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous 
group-level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity 
conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including 
labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and 
development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples. 
Finally, an empirical application of our estimator finds that low-wage 
earners in the US from 1990-2007 were significantly more affected by 
increased Chinese import competition than high-wage earners.</div>

						<div style="font-size:12px; display:none;" id="paper_21789_abstract">A
 firm's decision to expand or contract has long term strategic 
implications for its market outcomes, industry evolution and structure. 
Further, some firms may expand and become more profitable whereas 
expansion may be detrimental for others. Thus, there may be a 
heterogeneous relationship between firm size and profitability. 
Moreover, it is a stylized fact that the dynamics of retail market 
structure are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de 
novo entry or permanent exit.  Motivated by these considerations this 
paper develops a dynamic oligopoly model of endogenous firm size that 
allows size to affect future profitability, and market dominance. The 
model allows the dynamic link between firm size and profitability to be 
heterogenous. The spillovers of firm size on future profitability are 
implemented through a firm specific unobservable (to the researcher) 
that incorporates retention of past size spillovers through serial 
persistence due to firm specific heterogeneity. As a methodological 
contribution, the hurdle of estimating the model is surmounted by 
extending the Bajari, Benkard and Levin (2007) two-step procedure that 
doesn't require solving the game. The first stage combines 
semi-parametric Conditional Choice Probability estimation with particle 
filters to integrate out the serially correlated unobservables. The 
second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate payoff 
parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 
1970 to 2005 provides evidence of heterogeneity in size spillovers and 
serial persistence in profitability across firms. This heterogeneous 
dynamic linkage shows how some firms become dominant and others falter 
as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and industry 
concentration.</div>
